Moles and equationsMasses of atoms and molecules
Relative atomic mass, Ar
Atoms of different elements have different masses. When
we perform chemical calculations, we need to know how
heavy one atom is compared with another. The mass of
a single atom is so small that it is impossible to weigh it
directly. To overcome this problem, we have to weigh a lot
of atoms. We then compare this mass with the mass of the
same number of ‘standard’ atoms. Scientists have chosen
to use the isotope carbon-12 as the standard. This has been
given a mass of exactly 12 units. The mass of other atoms is
found by comparing their mass with the mass of carbon-12
atoms. This is called the relative atomic mass, Ar.
The relative atomic mass is the weighted average mass of
naturally occurring atoms of an element on a scale where
an atom of carbon-12 has a mass of exactly 12 units.
From this it follows that:
Ar [element Y]
= average mass of one atom of element Y × 12____________________________________
mass of one atom of carbon-12
We use the average mass of the atom of a particular element
because most elements are mixtures of isotopes. For example,
the exact Ar of hydrogen is 1.0079. This is very close to 1 and
most periodic tables give the Ar of hydrogen as 1.0. However,
some elements in the Periodic Table have values that are not
whole numbers. For example, the Ar for chlorine is 35.5. This
is because chlorine has two isotopes. In a sample of chlorine,
chlorine-35 makes up about three-quarters of the chlorine
atoms and chlorine-37 makes up about a quarter.
Relative isotopic mass
Isotopes are atoms that have the same number of protons
but different numbers of neutrons (see page 28). We represent
the nucleon number (the total number of neutrons plus
protons in an atom) by a number written at the top
left-hand corner of the atom’s symbol, e.g. 20 Ne, or by
a number written after the atom’s name or symbol, e.g.
neon-20 or Ne-20.
We use the term relative isotopic mass for the mass
of a particular isotope of an element on a scale where
an atom of carbon-12 has a mass of exactly 12 units. For
example, the relative isotopic mass of carbon-13 is 13.00.
If we know both the natural abundance of every isotope
of an element and their isotopic masses, we can calculate
Introduction
For thousands of years, people have heated rocks and
distilled plant juices to extract materials. Over the
past two centuries, chemists have learnt more and
more about how to get materials from rocks, from
the air and the sea, and from plants. They have also
found out the right conditions to allow these materials
to react together to make new substances, such as
dyes, plastics and medicines. When we make a new
substance it is important to mix the reactants in the
correct proportions to ensure that none is wasted. In
order to do this we need to know about the relative
masses of atoms and molecules and how these are
used in chemical calculations.
Figure 1.1 A titration is a method used to find the amount of
a particular substance in a solution.

Cambridge International AS Level Chemistrythe relative atomic mass of the element very accurately.
To find the necessary data we use an instrument called a
mass spectrometer (see box on mass spectrometry).
Relative molecular mass, Mr
The relative molecular mass of a compound (Mr) is the
relative mass of one molecule of the compound on a
scale where the carbon-12 isotope has a mass of exactly
12 units. We find the relative molecular mass by adding
up the relative atomic masses of all the atoms present in
the molecule.
For example, for methane:
formula CH4
atoms present 1 × C; 4 × H
add Ar values (1 × Ar[C]) + (4 × Ar[H])
Mr of methane = (1 × 12.0) + (4 × 1.0)
= 16.0
Relative formula mass
For compounds containing ions we use the term relative
formula mass. This is calculated in the same way as for
relative molecular mass. It is also given the same symbol,
Mr. For example, for magnesium hydroxide:
formula Mg(OH)2
ions present 1 × Mg 2+; 2 × (OH–)
add Ar values (1 × Ar[Mg]) + (2 × (Ar[O] + Ar[H]))
Mr of magnesium
hydroxide = (1 × 24.3) + (2 × (16.0 + 1.0))
= 58.3
Accurate relative atomic masses
1 Use the Periodic Table on page 473 to calculate the
relative formula masses of the following:
a calcium chloride, CaCl 2
b copper(II) sulfate, CuSO 4
c ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2 SO 4
d magnesium nitrate-6-water, Mg(NO3)2 .6H2O
Hint: for part d you need to calculate the mass of
water separately and then add it to the Mr of Mg(NO3)2 .

bOx 1.1: biological drawingA mass spectrometer (Figure 1.2) can be used
to measure the mass of each isotope present
in an element. It also compares how much of
each isotope is present – the relative abundance
(isotopic abundance). A simplified diagram of a
mass spectrometer is shown in Figure 1.3 . You will
not be expected to know the details of how a mass
spectrometer works, but it is useful to understand
how the results are obtained.

3chapter 1: Moles and equationsDetermination of Ar from mass spectra
We can use the data obtained from a mass spectrometer
to calculate the relative atomic mass of an element very
accurately. To calculate the relative atomic mass we follow
this method:
■■ multiply each isotopic mass by its percentage abundance
■■ add the figures together
■■ divide by 100.
We can use this method to calculate the relative atomic
mass of neon from its mass spectrum, shown in Figure 1.5.
The mass spectrum of neon has three peaks:
20 Ne (90.9%), 21Ne (0.3%) and 22 Ne (8.8%).
Ar of neon
= (20 × 90.9) + (21.0 × 0.3) + (22 × 8.8)_______________________________
100 = 20.2
Note that this answer is given to 3 significant figures,
which is consistent with the data given.

A high-resolution mass spectrometer can give very
accurate relative isotopic masses. For example 16 O = 15.995
and 32 S = 31.972. Because of this, chemists can distinguish
between molecules such as SO2 and S2 , which appear to
have the same relative molecular mass.
The atoms of the element in the vaporised sample
are converted into ions. The stream of ions is
brought to a detector after being deflected (bent)
by a strong magnetic field. As the magnetic field is
increased, the ions of heavier and heavier isotopes
are brought to the detector. The detector is
connected to a computer, which displays the
mass spectrum.
The mass spectrum produced shows the relative
abundance (isotopic abundance) on the vertical
axis and the mass to ion charge ratio (m/e) on the
horizontal axis. Figure 1.4 shows a typical mass
spectrum for a sample of lead. Table 1.1 shows
how the data is interpreted.

4cambridge International As Level chemistryAmount of substance
the mole and the Avogadro constant
The formula of a compound shows us the number of
atoms of each element present in one formula unit or one
molecule of the compound. In water we know that two
atoms of hydrogen (Ar = 1.0) combine with one atom of
oxygen (Ar = 16.0). So the ratio of mass of hydrogen atoms
to oxygen atoms in a water molecule is 2 : 16. No matter
how many molecules of water we have, this ratio will
always be the same. But the mass of even 1000 atoms is
far too small to be weighed. We have to scale up much
more than this to get an amount of substance that is easy
to weigh.
The relative atomic mass or relative molecular mass of
a substance in grams is called a mole of the substance. So a
mole of sodium (Ar = 23.0) weighs 23.0 g. The abbreviation
for a mole is mol. We define the mole in terms of the
standard carbon-12 isotope (see page 28).
One mole of a substance is the amount of that substance
that has the same number of specific particles (atoms,
molecules or ions) as there are atoms in exactly 12 g of the
carbon-12 isotope.
We often refer to the mass of a mole of substance as its
molar mass (abbreviation M). The units of molar mass
are g mol –1
.
The number of atoms in a mole of atoms is very large:
6.02 × 1023 atoms. This number is called the Avogadro
constant (or Avogadro number). The symbol for the
Avogadro constant is L (the symbol NA may also be used).
The Avogadro constant applies to atoms, molecules, ions
and electrons. So in 1 mole of sodium there are 6.02 × 1023
sodium atoms and in 1 mole of sodium chloride (NaCl) there
are 6.02 × 1023 sodium ions and 6.02 × 1023 chloride ions.
It is important to make clear what type of particles
we are referring to. If we just state ‘moles of chlorine’, it is
not clear whether we are thinking about chlorine atoms
or chlorine molecules. A mole of chlorine molecules, Cl 2 ,
contains 6.02 × 1023 chlorine molecules but twice as many
chlorine atoms, as there are two chlorine atoms in every
chlorine molecule.
Figure 1.7 Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856) was an Italian
scientist who first deduced that equal volumes of gases
contain equal numbers of molecules. Although the Avogadro
constant is named after him, it was left to other scientists to
calculate the number of particles in a mole.
Moles and mass
The Système International (SI) base unit for mass is the
kilogram. But this is a rather large mass to use for general
laboratory work in chemistry. So chemists prefer to use
the relative molecular mass or formula mass in grams
(1000 g = 1 kg). You can find the number of moles of a
substance by using the mass of substance and the relative
atomic mass (Ar) or relative molecular mass (Mr).

Mole calculations
Reacting masses
When reacting chemicals together we may need to know
what mass of each reactant to use so that they react exactly
and there is no waste. To calculate this we need to know
the chemical equation. This shows us the ratio of moles
of the reactants and products – the stoichiometry of the
equation. The balanced equation shows this stoichiometry.
For example, in the reaction
Fe2 O3 + 3CO 2Fe + 3CO2
1 mole of iron(III) oxide reacts with 3 moles of carbon
monoxide to form 2 moles of iron and 3 moles of carbon
dioxide. The stoichiometry of the equation is 1 : 3 : 2 : 3.
The large numbers that are included in the equation
(3, 2 and 3) are called stoichiometric numbers.
In order to find the mass of products formed in a
chemical reaction we use:
■■ the mass of the reactants
■■ the molar mass of the reactants
■■ the balanced equation.

6cambridge International As Level chemistryIn this type of calculation we do not always need to know
the molar mass of each of the reactants. If one or more of
the reactants is in excess, we need only know the mass in
grams and the molar mass of the reactant that is not in
excess (the limiting reactant).
the stoichiometry of a reaction
We can find the stoichiometry of a reaction if we know the
amounts of each reactant that exactly react together and
the amounts of each product formed.

oxygen we get 36.0 g of water. (Ar values: H = 1.0, O = 16.0)

2 × 24.3 g 1 × 32.0 g 2 × (24.3 g + 16.0 g)
48.6 g 32.0 g 80.6 g
From this calculation we can deduce that:
■■ 32.0 g of oxygen are needed to react exactly with
48.6 g of magnesium
■■ 80.6 g of magnesium oxide are formed.
If we burn 12.15 g of magnesium (0.5 mol) we get
20.15 g of magnesium oxide. This is because the
stoichiometry of the reaction shows us that for every
mole of magnesium burnt we get the same number of
moles of magnesium oxide.

The molecular formula shows the actual number of each
of the different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular
formula is more useful than the empirical formula. We
use the molecular formula to write balanced equations
and to calculate molar masses. The molecular formula is
always a multiple of the empirical formula. For example,
the molecular formula of ethane, C 2 H6 , is two times the
empirical formula, CH 3 .
In order to deduce the molecular formula we need
to know:
■■ the relative formula mass of the compound
■■ the empirical formula.
chemical formulae and
chemical equations
Deducing the formula
The electronic structure of the individual elements in a
compound determines the formula of a compound (see
page 33). The formula of an ionic compound is determined by
the charges on each of the ions present. The number of positive
charges is balanced by the number of negative charges so that
the total charge on the compound is zero. We can work out the
formula for a compound if we know the charges on the ions.
Figure 1.11 shows the charges on some simple ions related to
the position of the elements in the Periodic Table. The form
of the Periodic Table that we shall be using has 18 groups
because the transition elements are numbered as Groups
3 to 12. So, aluminium is in Group 13 and chlorine is in
Group 17.
For simple metal ions in Groups 1 and 2, the value of
the positive charge is the same as the group number. For
a simple metal ion in Group 13, the value of the positive
charge is 3+. For a simple non-metal ion in Groups 15 to
17, the value of the negative charge is 18 minus the group

The formula of a covalent compound is deduced from the
number of electrons needed to achieve the stable electronic
configuration of a noble gas (see page 49). In general,
carbon atoms form four bonds with other atoms, hydrogen
and halogen atoms form one bond and oxygen atoms form
two bonds. So the formula of water, H 2 O, follows these
rules. The formula for methane is CH4 , with each carbon
atom bonding with four hydrogen atoms. However, there
are many exceptions to these rules.

the iron oxide as come from the carbon monoxide.
Balancing chemical equations
When chemicals react, atoms cannot be either created
or destroyed. So there must be the same number of each
type of atom on the reactants side of a chemical equation
as there are on the products side. A symbol equation is a
shorthand way of describing a chemical reaction. It shows
the number and type of the atoms in the reactants and the
number and type of atoms in the products. If these are
the same, we say the equation is balanced. Follow these
examples to see how we balance an equation.
Using state symbols
We sometimes find it useful to specify the physical states
of the reactants and products in a chemical reaction. This
is especially important where chemical equilibrium and
rates of reaction are being discussed (see Chapter 8 and
Chapter 9). We use the following state symbols:
■■ (s) solid
■■ (l) liquid
■■ (g) gas
■■ (aq) aqueous (a solution in water).
State symbols are written after the formula of each
reactant and product. For example:
ZnCO3 (s) + H 2 SO 4 (aq) ZnSO 4 (aq) + H 2 O(l) + CO2 (g)

13 Balancing an equation
step 1 Write down the formulae of all the reactants and

step 2 Count the number of atoms of each reactant
and product.
H2 + O2 H2O
2[H] 2[O] 2[H] + 1[O]
step 3 Balance one of the atoms by placing a number
in front of one of the reactants or products. In this case
the oxygen atoms on the right-hand side need to be
balanced, so that they are equal in number to those on
the left-hand side. Remember that the number in front
multiplies everything in the formula. For example, 2H2O
has 4 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms.
H2 + O2 2H2O
2[H] 2[O] 4[H] + 2[O]
step 4 Keep balancing in this way, one type of atom at
a time until all the atoms are balanced.
2H2 + O2 2H2O
4[H] 2[O] 4[H] + 2[O]

change the formulae of any of the reactants
or products.

Balancing ionic equations
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions
separate from each other. For example:
NaCl(s) + aq Na+ (aq) + Cl– (aq)
Ionic compounds include salts such as sodium bromide,
magnesium sulfate and ammonium nitrate. Acids and
alkalis also contain ions. For example H+ (aq) and Cl– (aq)
ions are present in hydrochloric acid and Na+ (aq) and
OH– (aq) ions are present in sodium hydroxide.
Many chemical reactions in aqueous solution involve
ionic compounds. Only some of the ions in solution take
part in these reactions.
The ions that play no part in the reaction are called
spectator ions.
An ionic equation is simpler than a full chemical
equation. It shows only the ions or other particles that are
reacting. Spectator ions are omitted. Compare the full
equation for the reaction of zinc with aqueous copper(II)
sulfate with the ionic equation.

they have not changed
■■ both the charges and the atoms are balanced.

solutions and concentration
calculating the concentration of
a solution
The concentration of a solution is the amount of
solute dissolved in a solvent to make 1 dm 3 (one cubic
decimetre) of solution. The solvent is usually water. There
are 1000 cm 3 in a cubic decimetre. When 1 mole of a
compound is dissolved to make 1 dm 3 of solution the
concentration is 1 mol dm–3 .
concentration (mol dm–3)
= number of moles of solute (mol)___________________________
volume of solution (dm 3)
We use the terms ‘concentrated’ and ‘dilute’ to refer to the
relative amount of solute in the solution. A solution with a
low concentration of solute is a dilute solution. If there is a
high concentration of solute, the solution is concentrated.
When performing calculations involving
concentrations in mol dm–3 you need to:
■■ change mass in grams to moles
■■ change cm3 to dm3 (by dividing the number of cm 3 by 1000).

of sodium hydroxide we use the following procedure.
■■ Get some of acid of known concentration.
■■ Fill a clean burette with the acid (after having washed
the burette with a little of the acid).
■■ Record the initial burette reading.
■■ Measure a known volume of the alkali into a titration
flask using a graduated (volumetric) pipette.
■■ Add an indicator solution to the alkali in the flask.
■■ Slowly add the acid from the burette to the flask,
swirling the flask all the time until the indicator changes
colour (the end-point).
CArryIng OuT A TITrATIOn
■■ Record the final burette reading. The final reading
minus the initial reading is called the titre. This first
titre is normally known as a ‘rough’ value.
■■ Repeat this process, adding the acid drop by drop
near the end-point.
■■ Repeat again, until you have two titres that are no
more than 0.10 cm 3 apart.
■■ Take the average of these two titre values.
Your results should be recorded in a table, looking
like this:
rough 1 2 3
final burette
reading / cm3
37.60 38.65 36.40 34.75
initial burette
reading / cm 3
2.40 4.00 1.40 0.00
titre / cm 3 35.20 34.65 35.00 34.75
15Chapter 1: Moles and equationsYou should note:
■■ all burette readings are given to an accuracy
of 0.05 cm 3
■■ the units are shown like this ‘/ cm 3 ’
■■ the two titres that are no more than 0.10 cm 3 apart are
1 and 3, so they would be averaged
■■ the average titre is 34.70 cm 3 .
In every titration there are five important pieces of
knowledge:
1 the balanced equation for the reaction
2 the volume of the solution in the burette (in the
example above this is hydrochloric acid)
CArryIng OuT A TITrATIOn (COnTInued)
3 the concentration of the solution in the burette
4 the volume of the solution in the titration flask (in the
example above this is sodium hydroxide)
5 the concentration of the solution in the
titration flask.
If we know four of these five things, we can calculate
the fifth. So in order to calculate the concentration
of sodium hydroxide in the flask we need to know
the first four of these points.

titration
A titration is often used to find the exact concentration
of a solution. Worked example 20 shows the steps used
to calculate the concentration of a solution of sodium
hydroxide when it is neutralised by aqueous sulfuric acid
of known concentration and volume.
Deducing stoichiometry by titration
We can use titration results to find the stoichiometry
of a reaction. In order to do this, we need to know the
concentrations and the volumes of both the reactants. The
example below shows how to determine the stoichiometry
of the reaction between a metal hydroxide and an acid.

balanced equation shows that 2 mol of NaOH react
with every 1 mol of H2 SO 4 .
Note 3 In step 3, we divide by 0.0250 because we have
changed cm3 to dm3 ( 0.0250 = 25.0_____

volumes
Using the molar gas volume
In 1811 the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro suggested
that equal volumes of all gases contain the same number
of molecules. This is called Avogadro’s hypothesis. This
idea is approximately true as long as the pressure is not
too high or the temperature too low. It is convenient to
measure volumes of gases at room temperature (20 °C)
and pressure (1 atmosphere). At room temperature and
pressure (r.t.p.) one mole of any gas has a volume of
24.0 dm 3 . So, 24.0 dm 3 of carbon dioxide and 24.0 dm 3 of
hydrogen both contain one mole of gas molecules.
We can use the molar gas volume of 24.0 dm 3 at r.t.p.
to find:
■■ the volume of a given mass or number of moles of gas
■■ the mass or number of moles of a given volume of gas.

One mole of hydroxide ions neutralises one mole of

hydroxide must contain two hydroxide ions in each
formula unit.

18cambridge International As Level chemistryWe can extend this idea to experiments involving
combustion data of hydrocarbons. The example below
shows how the formula of propane and the stoichiometry
of the equation can be deduced. Propane is a hydrocarbon
– a compound of carbon and hydrogen only.
Gas volumes and stoichiometry
We can use the ratio of reacting volumes of gases to
deduce the stoichiometry of a reaction. If we mix 20 cm 3
of hydrogen with 10 cm 3 of oxygen and explode the
mixture, we will find that the gases have exactly reacted
together and no hydrogen or oxygen remains. According
to Avogadro’s hypothesis, equal volumes of gases contain
equal numbers of molecules and therefore equal numbers
of moles of gases. So the mole ratio of hydrogen to oxygen
is 2 : 1. We can summarise this as:
hydrogen + oxygen water
(H2) (O 2) (H2O)

ratio of moles 2 : 1

As 1 mole of propane produces 3 moles of carbon dioxide,
there must be 3 moles of carbon atoms in one mole of

The 5 moles of oxygen molecules are used to react with
both the carbon and the hydrogen in the propane. 3 moles
of these oxygen molecules have been used in forming
carbon dioxide. So 5 – 3 = 2 moles of oxygen molecules
must be used in reacting with the hydrogen to form
water. There are 4 moles of atoms in 2 moles of oxygen
molecules. So there must be 4 moles of water formed.

atomic structureElements and atoms
Every substance in our world is made up from chemical
elements. These chemical elements cannot be broken down
further into simpler substances by chemical means. A few
elements, such as nitrogen and gold, are found on their
own in nature, not combined with other elements. Most
elements, however, are found in combination with other
elements as compounds.
Every element has its own chemical symbol. The
symbols are often derived from Latin or Greek words.
Some examples are shown in Table 2.1.
Element Symbol
carbon C
lithium Li (from Greek ‘lithos’)
iron Fe (from Latin ‘ferrum’)
potassium K (from Arabic ‘al-qualyah’ or from the
Latin ‘kalium’)
Table 2.1 Some examples of chemical symbols.
Chemical elements contain only one type of atom. An
atom is the smallest part of an element that can take part
in a chemical change. Atoms are very small. The diameter
of a hydrogen atom is approximately 10 –10 m, so the mass
of an atom must also be very small. A single hydrogen
atom weighs only 1.67 × 10 –27 kg.
Figure 2.2 Our Sun is made largely of the elements hydrogen
and helium. This is a composite image made using X-ray and
solar optical telescopes.
Inside the atom
The structure of an atom
Every atom has nearly all of its mass concentrated in a
tiny region in the centre of the atom called the nucleus.
The nucleus is made up of particles called nucleons. There
Introduction
In order to explain how chemical substances behaved,
scientists first had to understand what the substances
themselves were made from. Over time, a model was
developed in which all substances were composed
of atoms of elements. Originally it was thought that
atoms could not themselves be broken up into yet
smaller parts, but now we understand the structure
inside the atoms themselves, and the role of electrons,
protons and neutrons. We can now design and make
materials and objects almost at the atomic level.
Nanotechnology is the design and making of objects
that may have a thickness of only a few thousand
atoms or less. Groups of atoms can be moved around
on special surfaces. In this way scientists hope to
develop tiny machines that may help deliver medical
drugs to exactly where they are needed in the body.
Figure 2.1 Each of the blue peaks in this image is an
individual molecule. The molecules can be moved over
a copper surface, making this a molecular abacus or
counting device.
25Chapter 2: Atomic structureare two types of nucleon: protons and neutrons. Atoms of
different elements have different numbers of protons.
Outside the nucleus, particles called electrons move
around in regions of space called orbitals (see page 37).
Chemists often find it convenient to use a model of the
atom in which electrons move around the nucleus in
electron shells. Each shell is a certain distance from the
nucleus at its own particular energy level (see page 37).
In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the
number of protons. A simple model of a carbon atom is
shown in Figure 2.3.

(energy levels)
Figure 2.3 A model of a carbon atom. This model is not very
accurate but it is useful for understanding what happens to
the electrons during chemical reactions.
Atoms are tiny, but the nucleus of an atom is far tinier
still. If the diameter of an atom were the size of a football
stadium, the nucleus would only be the size of a pea. This
means that most of the atom is empty space! Electrons are
even smaller than protons and neutrons.
Figure 2.4 Ernest Rutherford (left) and Hans Geiger (right)
using their alpha-particle apparatus. Interpretation of
the results led to Rutherford proposing the nuclear model
for atoms.
We can deduce the electric charge of subatomic
particles by showing how beams of electrons,
protons and neutrons behave in electric fields. If we
fire a beam of electrons past electrically charged
plates, the electrons are deflected (bent) away from
the negative plate and towards the positive plate
(Figure 2.5a). This shows us that the electrons are
negatively charged.
A cathode-ray tube (Figure 2.5b) can be used to
produce beams of electrons. At one end of the tube

26Cambridge International AS Level Chemistryis a metal wire (cathode), which is heated to a high
temperature when a low voltage is applied to it. At
the other end of the tube is a fluorescent screen,
which glows when electrons hit it.
The electrons are given off from the heated wire and
are attracted towards two metal plates, which are
positively charged. As they pass through the metal
plates the electrons form a beam. When the electron
beam hits the screen a spot of light is produced.
When an electric field is applied across this beam
the electrons are deflected (bent). The fact that the
electrons are so easily attracted to the positively
charged anode and that they are easily deflected by
an electric field shows us that:
■■ electrons have a negative charge
■■ electrons have a very small mass.
EXpErImENTs WITh subaTOmIc parTIclEs (cONTINuEd)
In recent years, experiments have been carried out
with beams of electrons, protons and neutrons. The
results of these experiments show that:
■■ a proton beam is deflected away from a positively
charged plate; as like charges repel, the protons must
have a positive charge (Figure 2.7 )
■■ an electron beam is deflected towards a positively
charged plate; as unlike charges attract, the electrons
must have a negative charge
■■ a beam of neutrons is not deflected; this is because
they are uncharged.
In these experiments, huge voltages have to be
used to show the deflection of the proton beam.
This contrasts with the very low voltages needed
to show the deflection of an electron beam. These
experiments show us that protons are much heavier
than electrons. If we used the same voltage to
deflect electrons and protons, the beam of electrons
would have a far greater deflection than the beam
of protons. This is because a proton is about 2000
times as heavy as an electron.
Figure 2.6 J. J. Thomson calculated the charge to mass
ratio of electrons. He used results from experiments with
electrons in cathode-ray tubes.

27Chapter 2: Atomic structureMasses and charges: a summary
Electrons, protons and neutrons have characteristic charges
and masses. The values of these are too small

Numbers of nucleons
Proton number and nucleon number
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called
the proton number (Z). It is also known as the atomic
number. Every atom of the same element has the same
number of protons in its nucleus. It is the proton number
that makes an atom what it is. For example, an atom with
a proton number of 11 must be an atom of the element
sodium. The Periodic Table of elements is arranged in order
of the proton numbers of the individual elements
(see Appendix 1, page 473).
The nucleon number (A) is the number of protons plus
neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. This is also known as
the mass number.
How many neutrons?
We can use the nucleon number and proton number to find
the number of neutrons in an atom. As:
nucleon number = number of protons + number of neutrons
Then:
number of neutrons = nucleon number – number of protons
= A – Z
For example, an atom of aluminium has a nucleon number
of 27 and a proton number of 13. So an aluminium atom
has 27 – 13 = 14 neutrons.
Isotopes
All atoms of the same element have the same number of
protons. However, they may have different numbers of
neutrons. Atoms of the same element that have differing
numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different
nucleon (mass) numbers.
Isotopes of a particular element have the same chemical
properties because they have the same number of
electrons. They have slightly different physical properties,
such as small differences in density.
We can write symbols for isotopes. We write the
nucleon number at the top left of the chemical symbol and
the proton number at the bottom left.
The symbol for the isotope of boron with 5 protons and
11 nucleons is written:
nucleon number 11
proton number 5 B
Hydrogen has three isotopes. The atomic structure and
isotopic symbols for the three isotopes of hydrogen are
shown in Figure 2.8.
When writing generally about isotopes, chemists also
name them by omitting the proton number and placing
the nucleon number after the name. For example, the
isotopes of hydrogen can be called hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2
and hydrogen-3.

How many protons, neutrons
and electrons?
In a neutral atom the number of positively charged protons
in the nucleus equals the number of negatively charged
electrons outside the nucleus. When an atom gains or loses
electrons, ions are formed, which are electrically charged.
For example:
Cl + e – Cl–
chlorine atom 1 electron gained chloride ion
17 protons 17 protons
17 electrons 18 electrons
The chloride ion has a single negative charge because there
are 17 protons (+) and 18 electrons (–).
29Chapter 2: Atomic structureSummary
■ Every atom has an internal structure with a nucleus
in the centre and the negatively charged electrons
arranged in ‘shells’ outside the nucleus.
■ Most of the mass of the atom is in the nucleus, which
contains protons (positively charged) and neutrons
(uncharged).
■ Beams of protons and electrons are deflected by
electric fields but neutrons are not.
■ All atoms of the same element have the same
number of protons. This is the proton number (Z),
which is also called the atomic number.
■ The nucleon number, which is also called the mass
number (A), is the total number of protons and
neutrons in an atom.
■ The number of neutrons in an atom is found by
subtracting the proton number from the nucleon
number (A – Z).
■ In a neutral atom, number of electrons = number
of protons. When there are more protons than
electrons, the atom becomes a positive ion. When
there are more electrons than protons, a negatively
charged ion is formed.
■ Isotopes are atoms with the same atomic number
but different nucleon numbers. They only differ in
the number of neutrons they contain.

Chapter 3:
electrons in atomsSimple electronic structure
On page 26 we saw that electrons are arranged outside the
nucleus in energy levels or quantum shells. These principal
energy levels or principal quantum shells (symbol n) are
numbered according to how far they are from the nucleus.
The lowest energy level, n = 1, is closest to the nucleus, the
energy level n = 2 is further out, and so on. The electrons
in quantum shells further away from the nucleus have
more energy and are held less tightly to the nucleus.
The arrangement of electrons in an atom is called its
electronic structure or electronic configuration. The
electronic configurations of lithium, carbon and neon are
shown in Figure 3.2, together with a shorthand way of
writing this structure.

Introduction
The arrangement of the electrons within each atom
determines how that atom interacts with other atoms
and with its surroundings. The electrons are organised
into different levels of energy, and understanding the
effects of this arrangement is key to understanding
chemistry itself. We can also make use of these
electron levels. For example, causing an electron to
move between energy levels can cause energy to be
emitted or absorbed. Sometimes, we can see this in
the form of light.
Figure 3.1 Electrons moving between energy levels are the
source of this light energy. Chemicals in the tubes are said to
be ‘chemiluminescent’.
33Chapter 3: Electrons in atomsEvidence for electronic structure
Ionisation energy, ΔHi
By firing high-speed electrons at atoms, scientists can
work out how much energy has to be supplied to form an
ion by knocking out one electron from each atom.
The energy change that accompanies this process is
called the ionisation energy.
The 1st ionisation energy of an element is the energy
needed to remove one electron from each atom in one
mole of atoms of the element in the gaseous state to form
one mole of gaseous 1+ ions.
Ionisation energies are measured under standard
conditions. The general symbol for ionisation energy is
ΔHi . Its units are kJ mol–1.
The symbol for the 1st ionisation energy is ΔHi1. Using
calcium as an example:
1st ionisation energy: Ca(g) Ca+ (g) + e –
ΔHi1 = 590 kJ mol–1
If a second electron is removed from each ion in a mole of
gaseous 1+ ions, we call it the 2nd ionisation energy, ΔHi2 .
Again, using calcium as an example:
2nd ionisation energy: Ca+ (g) Ca 2+ (g) + e –
ΔHi2 = 1150 kJ mol–1
Removal of a third electron from each ion in a mole of
gaseous 2+ ions is called the 3rd ionisation energy. Again,
using calcium as an example:
3rd ionisation energy: Ca 2+ (g) Ca 3+ (g) + e –
ΔHi3 = 4940 kJ mol–1
We can continue to remove electrons from an atom until
only the nucleus is left. We call this sequence of ionisation
energies, successive ionisation energies.
The successive ionisation energies for the first 11
elements in the Periodic Table are shown in Table 3.2.
The data in Table 3.2 shows us that:
■■ For each element, the successive ionisation energies
increase. This is because the charge on the ion gets
greater as each electron is removed. As each electron is
removed there is a greater attractive force between the
positively charged protons in the nucleus and the remaining
negatively charged electrons. Therefore more energy is
needed to overcome these attractive forces.
■■ There is a big difference between some successive
ionisation energies. For nitrogen this occurs between
the 5th and 6th ionisation energies. For sodium the first
big difference occurs between the 1st and 2nd ionisation
energies. These large changes indicate that for the second
of these two ionisation energies the electron being removed
is from a principal quantum shell closer to the nucleus.
For example, for the 5th ionisation energy of nitrogen,
the electron being removed is from the 2nd principal
quantum shell. For the 6th ionisation energy of nitrogen,
the electron being removed is from the 1st principal
quantum shell.

QueSTion
Figure 3.3 The frequencies of the lines in an atomic
emission spectrum can be used to calculate a value for the
ionisation energy.
34Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryThree factors that influence ionisation
energies
1 The size of the nuclear charge
As the atomic number (number of protons) increases, the
positive nuclear charge increases. The bigger the positive
charge, the greater the attractive force between the nucleus
and the electrons. So, more energy is needed to overcome
these attractive forces if an electron is to be removed.
■■ In general, ionisation energy increases as the proton
number increases.
2 Distance of outer electrons from the
nucleus
The force of attraction between positive and negative
charges decreases rapidly as the distance between them
increases. So, electrons in shells further away from the
nucleus are less attracted to the nucleus than those closer
to the nucleus.
■■ The further the outer electron shell is from the nucleus, the
lower the ionisation energy.
3 Shielding effect of inner electrons
As all electrons are negatively charged, they repel each
other. Electrons in full inner shells repel electrons in outer
shells. Full inner shells of electrons prevent the full nuclear
charge being felt by the outer electrons. This is called
shielding. The greater the shielding of outer electrons by
the inner electron shells, the lower the attractive forces
between the nucleus and the outer electrons.
■■ The ionisation energy is lower as the number of full
electron shells between the outer electrons and the
nucleus increases.

Figure 3.4 Graph of logarithm (log 10 ) of ionisation energy of
sodium against the number of electrons removed.
We can deduce the following about sodium from
Figure 3.4:
■■ The first electron removed has a low 1st ionisation energy,
when compared with the rest of the data. It is very easily
removed from the atom. It is therefore likely to be a long way
from the nucleus and well shielded by inner electron shells.
■■ The second electron is much more difficult to remove than
the first electron. There is a big jump in the value of the
ionisation energy. This suggests that the second electron is
in a shell closer to the nucleus than the first electron. Taken
together, the 1st and 2nd ionisation energies suggest that
sodium has one electron in its outer shell.
■■ From the second to the ninth electrons removed there is
only a gradual change in successive ionisation energies. This
suggests that all these eight electrons are in the same shell.
■■ The 10th and 11th electrons have extremely high ionisation
energies, when compared with the rest of the data. This
suggests that they are very close to the nucleus. There must
be a very great force of attraction between the nucleus and
these electrons and there are no inner electrons to shield
them. The large increase in ionisation energy between the
9th and 10th electrons confirms that the 10th electron is in a
shell closer to the nucleus than the 9th electron.
Figure 3.5 shows this arrangement of electrons.

We look for a large jump in the value of the ionisation

6th and 7th electrons. So, six electrons have been
removed comparatively easily. The removal of the
7th electron requires about three times the energy
required to remove the 6th electron. So, there must be
six electrons in the outer shell of x. So, element x must
be in Group 16 of the Periodic Table.

36Cambridge International AS Level ChemistrySubshells and atomic orbitals
Quantum subshells
The principal quantum shells, apart from the first, are split
into subshells (sublevels). Each principal quantum shell
contains a different number of subshells. The subshells
are distinguished by the letters s, p or d. There are also f
subshells for elements with more than 57 electrons. Figure
3.6 shows the subshells for the first four principal quantum
levels. In any principal quantum shell, the energy of the
electrons in the subshells increases in the order s < p < d.
The maximum number of electrons that are allowed
in each subshell is: s = 2 electrons, p = 6 electrons,
d = 10 electrons.
■■ The first principal quantum level, n = 1, can hold a maximum
of 2 electrons in an s subshell.
■■ The second principal quantum level, n = 2, can hold a
maximum of 8 electrons: 2 electrons in the s subshell and
6 electrons in the p subshell.
■■ The third principal quantum level, n = 3, can hold a maximum
of 18 electrons: 2 electrons in the s subshell, 6 electrons in the
p subshell and 10 electrons in the d subshell.
You will also notice from Figure 3.6 that the order of
the subshells in terms of increasing energy does not
follow a regular pattern of s then p then d after the
element argon. The order of subshells after argon appears
to overlap. The next element after argon is potassium.
Potassium’s outer electron is in the 4s, not in the 3d,
subshell. The first element with an electron in the 3d
subshell is element 21, scandium.
When high-speed electrons hit gas particles at low
pressure, coloured lines are seen through an instrument
called a spectroscope. The letters s, p and d come from
the terms used to describe these lines: s for ‘sharp’, p for
‘principal’ and ‘d for ‘diffuse’.
Atomic orbitals
Each subshell contains one or more atomic orbitals.
An atomic orbital is a region of space around the nucleus
of an atom that can be occupied by one or two electrons.
As each orbital can only hold a maximum of two electrons,
the number of orbitals in each subshell must be:
s – one orbital
p – three orbitals
d – five orbitals.

37Chapter 3: Electrons in atomsShapes of the orbitals
Each orbital has a three-dimensional shape. Within this
shape there is a high probability of finding the electron or
electrons in the orbital. Figure 3.7 shows how we represent
the s and p orbitals.

Figure 3.7 Representations of orbitals (the position of the
nucleus is shown by the black dot): a s orbitals are spherical;
b p orbitals, px, py and pz, have ‘lobes’ along the x, y and
z axes.
An s orbital has a spherical shape. The 2s orbital in the
second principal quantum shell has the same shape as
the 1s orbital in the first quantum shell. They are both
spherical, but electrons in the 2s orbital have more energy
than electrons in the 1s orbital. There are three 2p orbitals
in the second quantum shell. Each of these has the same
shape. The shape is like an hourglass with two ‘lobes’. The
three sets of ‘lobes’ are arranged at right angles to each
other along the x, y and z axes. Hence the three 2p orbitals
are named 2px, 2py and 2pz. The three 2p orbitals have the
same energy as each other. There are also three 3p orbitals
in the third quantum shell. Their shapes are similar to the
shapes of the 2p orbitals.
The d orbitals are more complex in shape and
arrangement in space. In 1925 Louis de Broglie
suggested that electrons behaved like waves. This led
to the idea of electron probability clouds. The electron
probability cloud for one type of d orbital is very strange –
it is like a modified p orbital with a ring around the middle
(Figure 3.8). You will not need to know the d-orbital
shapes at AS level, but you will for A level when studying
the transition elements (see Chapter 24).
Figure 3.8 The shape of a dz2 orbital.
Filling the shells and orbitals
The most stable electronic configuration (electronic
structure) of an atom is the one that has the lowest amount
of energy. The order in which the subshells are filled
depends on their relative energy. The subshell with the
lowest energy, the 1s, is therefore filled first, followed by
those that are successively higher in energy. As we noted in
Figure 3.6, the order of the subshells in terms of increasing
energy does not follow a regular pattern of s then p then d
after argon, where the 3p subshell is full. Figure 3.9 shows
the order of filling the subshells.

[Ar] 3d1 4s2 . This is because electrons occupy the
orbitals with the lowest energy – the 3d subshell is just
above the 4s subshell but below the 4p subshell. This
begins a pattern of filling the 3d subshell ending with
zinc. Zinc has the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s2 .
■■ Chromium and copper
The electronic configurations of chromium and copper
do not follow the expected pattern. Chromium has
the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d 5 4s1 (rather than
the expected [Ar] 3d4 4s2). Copper has the electronic
configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s1 (rather than the expected
[Ar] 3d 9 4s2). You will have to learn that these two
elements are exceptions to the pattern.

The electronic configurations of some of the elements
after argon are shown in Table 3.6. In this table part of the
electronic configuration of each element is represented
by [Ar]. This ‘noble gas core’ represents the electronic
configuration of argon: 1s 2 2s2 2p 6 3s2 3p 6 . This method is
a shorthand way of writing electronic structures of atoms

You should note the following:
■■ Electronic configuration of potassium
Potassium has the electronic structure
1s2 2s2 2p 6 3s2 3p 6 4s1. The outer electron goes into the
4s subshell rather than the 3d subshell because the 4s is
below the 3d in terms of its energy.

Orbitals and the Periodic Table
The arrangement of elements in the Periodic Table reflects
the electronic structure of the elements. The Periodic Table
can be split into blocks of elements (Figure 3.10).
■■ Elements in Groups 1 and 2 have outer electrons in an
s subshell.
■■ Elements in Groups 3 to 18 (apart from He) have outer
electrons in a p subshell.
■■ Elements that add electrons to the d subshells are called
the d-block elements. Most of these are transition elements.
Filling the orbitals
A useful way of representing electronic configurations is a
diagram that places electrons in boxes (Figure 3.11).
■■ Each box represents an atomic orbital.
■■ The boxes (orbitals) can be arranged in order of increasing
energy from bottom to top.
■■ An electron is represented by an arrow.
■■ The direction of the arrow represents the ‘spin’ of the
electron. (We imagine an electron rotating around its own
axis either in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction.)
■■ When there are two electrons in an orbital, the ‘spins’ of the
electrons are opposite, so the two arrows in this box point in
opposite directions.

Electrons in the same region of space repel each other
because they have the same charge. So wherever possible,
electrons will occupy separate orbitals in the same subshell
to minimise this repulsion. These electrons have their
‘spin’ in the same direction. Electrons are only paired
when there are no more empty orbitals available within
a subshell. The spins are then opposite to minimise
repulsion. Figure 3.12 shows the electronic structures of
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen to illustrate these points.

the electrons are only paired when no more empty orbitals

Electronic configuration of ions
Positive ions are formed when electrons are removed from
atoms. The sodium ion, Na+ (proton number = 11), has
10 electrons. So, its electronic configuration is 1s 2 2s2 2p 6 .
Note that this is the same as the electronic configuration
of neon, the element with 10 electrons in each atom.
Negative ions are formed when atoms gain electrons.
The sulfide ion, S2– (proton number = 16), has 18 electrons.
Its electronic configuration is 1s 2 2s2 2p 6 3s2 3p 6 , which is
the same as argon, the element with 18 electrons in each
atom.
Note that, in general, electrons in the outer subshell
are removed when metal ions form their positive ions.
However, the d-block elements behave slightly differently.
Reading across the Periodic Table from potassium to zinc,
the 4s subshell fills before the 3d subshell. But when atoms
of a d-block element lose electrons to form ions, the 4s
electrons are lost first.
For example:
Ti atom: 1s2 2s2 2p 6 3s2 3p 6 3d 2 4s2
Ti 2+ ion: 1s2 2s2 2p 6 3s2 3p 6 3d 2
Cr atom: 1s2 2s2 2p 6 3s2 3p 6 3d 5 4s1
Cr3+ ion: 1s2 2s2 2p 6 3s2 3p 6 3d 3

Patterns across a period
Figure 3.13 shows how the first ionisation energy, ΔHi1,

Figure 3.13 A graph of the first ionisation energies of the
elements hydrogen to sodium plotted against atomic number.
1 There is a general increase in ΔHi1 across a period. This
applies to Period 1 (hydrogen and helium), Period 2
(lithium to neon) and also to other periods. As you go
across a period the nuclear charge increases. But the
electron removed comes from the same shell. So, the
force of attraction between the positive nucleus and the
outer negative electrons increases across the
period because:
i the nuclear charge increases
ii the distance between the nucleus and the outer
electron remains reasonably constant
iii the shielding by inner shells remains
reasonably constant.
2 There is a rapid decrease in ionisation energy between
the last element in one period and the first element in
the next period. The ΔHi1 for lithium is much smaller
than the ΔHi1 for helium. Helium has two electrons.
These are in the first quantum shell. But lithium has
three electrons. The third electron must go into the
next quantum shell further away from the nucleus. So,
the force of attraction between the positive nucleus and
the outer negative electrons decreases because:

c Fe3+ (Z = 26)
QueSTion
41Chapter 3: Electrons in atomsi the distance between the nucleus and the outer
electron increases
ii the shielding by inner shells increases
iii these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.
3 There is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 between beryllium
and boron. Although boron has one more proton than
beryllium, there is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 on removal
of the outer electron. Beryllium has the electronic
structure 1s 2 2s 2 and boron has the electronic
structure 1s 2 2s 2 2p1. The fifth electron in boron must
be in the 2p subshell, which is slightly further away
from the nucleus than the 2s subshell. There is less
attraction between the fifth electron in boron and the
nucleus because:
i the distance between the nucleus and the outer
electron increases slightly
ii the shielding by inner shells increases slightly
iii these two factors outweigh the increased
nuclear charge.
4 There is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 between nitrogen
and oxygen. Oxygen has one more proton than
nitrogen and the electron removed is in the same 2p
subshell. So, you might think that ΔHi1 would
increase. However, the spin-pairing of the electrons
plays a part here. If you look back at Figure 3.12, you
will see that the electron removed from the nitrogen
is from an orbital that contains an unpaired electron.
The electron removed from the oxygen is from the
orbital that contains a pair of electrons. The extra
repulsion between the pair of electrons in this orbital
results in less energy being needed to remove an
electron. So, ΔHi1 for oxygen is lower, because of
spin-pair repulsion.
These patterns repeat themselves across the third period.
However, the presence of the d-block elements in Period 4
disrupts the pattern, as d-block elements have first
ionisation energies that are relatively similar and fairly high.
Patterns down a group
The first ionisation energy decreases as you go down a
group in the Periodic Table. For example, in Group 1 the
values of ΔHi1 are:
■■ Li = 519 kJ mol –1
■■ Na = 494 kJ mol–1
■■ K = 418 kJ mol –1
■■ Rb = 403 kJ mol –1
As you go down the group, the outer electron removed
is from the same type of orbital but from a successively
higher principal quantum level – 2s from lithium, 3s
for sodium and 4s for potassium. Although the nuclear
charge is increasing down the group there is less attraction
between the outer electron and the nucleus because:
1 the distance between the nucleus and the outer
electron increases
2 the shielding by complete inner shells increases
3 these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.
10 a The first ionisation energies of four consecutive
elements in the Periodic Table are:
sodium = 494 kJ mol–1
magnesium = 736 kJ mol–1
aluminium = 577 kJ mol–1
silicon = 786 kJ mol–1
i Explain the general increase in ionisation
energies from sodium to silicon.
ii Explain why aluminium has a lower first
ionisation energy than magnesium.
b The first ionisation energy of fluorine is
1680 kJ mol–1 whereas the first ionisation energy of
iodine is 1010 kJ mol–1 . Explain why fluorine has a
higher first ionisation energy than iodine despite it

42Cambridge International AS Level ChemistrySummary
■ Electrons in an atom can exist only in certain energy
levels (shells) outside the nucleus.
■ The main energy levels (shells) are given principal
quantum numbers n = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. The lowest
energy level (n = 1) is closest to the nucleus.
■ The shells may be divided into subshells known
as s, p and d subshells, which can hold a maximum
of 2, 6 and 10 electrons, respectively.
■ The region of space in which an electron is likely to
be found is called an orbital. Each subshell has a
number of orbitals which can each hold a maximum
of two electrons. Subshells s, p and d have 1, 3 and 5
orbitals, respectively.
■ The s orbitals are spherical in shape. The p orbitals
have two ‘lobes’.
■ When two electrons are present in an orbital they
spin in opposite directions and are said to be paired.
■ The electronic configuration of atoms is found by
adding electrons to each orbital starting from those
in the lowest energy level.
■ When electrons are added to orbitals in the same
subshell they go into separate orbitals if possible.
Electrons pair up where this is not possible.
■ The 1st ionisation energy of an element is the energy
needed to remove one electron from each atom in
one mole of atoms of the element in the gaseous
state (to form gaseous 1+ ions).
■ The ionisation energies needed to remove the first,
second, third, fourth, etc., electrons from each
atom or ion in a mole of gaseous atoms are called
successive ionisation energies.
■ The magnitude of the ionisation energy depends on
these four factors:
– the distance of the electron from the nucleus
– the number of positive charges in the nucleus
– the degree of shielding of outer electrons by
inner electron shells
– spin-pair repulsion.
■ The trends in 1st ionisation energy of the elements
across a period and down a group can be explained
using the four factors above.
■ Values of successive ionisation energies of atoms
provide evidence for their electronic configuration.

Chapter 4:
Chemical bondingTypes of chemical bonding
Ionic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between positive
and negative ions in an ionic crystal lattice. Covalent bonds
are formed when the outer electrons of two atoms are shared.
The ionic or covalent bonds formed are usually very strong
– it takes a lot of energy to break them. There is also a third
form of strong bonding: metallic bonding.
Although the atoms within molecules are kept
together by strong covalent bonds, the forces between
molecules are weak. We call these weak forces
intermolecular forces.
There are several types of intermolecular force:
■■ van der Waals’ forces (also called ‘dispersion forces’ and
‘temporary dipole–induced dipole forces’)
■■ permanent dipole–dipole forces
■■ hydrogen bonds.
An understanding of these different types of chemical
bonding and an understanding of intermolecular forces
helps us to explain the structure and physical properties
of elements and compounds.
Ionic bonding
How are ions formed?
One way of forming ions is for atoms to gain or lose one or
more electrons.
■■ Positive ions are formed when an atom loses one or more
electrons. Metal atoms usually lose electrons and form
positive ions.
■■ Negative ions are formed when an atom gains one or
more electrons. Non-metal atoms usually gain electrons
and form negative ions.
The charge on the ion depends on the number of electrons
lost or gained (see page 41).
When metals combine with non-metals, the electrons
in the outer shell of the metal atoms are transferred to
the non-metal atoms. Each non-metal atom usually gains
enough electrons to fill its outer shell. As a result of this,
the metal and non-metal atoms usually end up with outer
electron shells that are complete – they have an electronic
configuration of a noble gas.
In Figure 4.2 we can see that:
■■ the sodium ion has the electronic structure [2,8]+, the same
as that of neon
■■ the chloride ion has the electronic structure [2,8,8] –, the
same as that of argon.
Introduction
In Chapter 3 we looked at the electronic configurations
of individual atoms. We can use these electronic
configurations to help us understand what happens
when atoms combine to form compounds. The atoms
in compounds are held together by different types of
chemical bonding. Understanding what bonding is,
and how bonds can be formed or broken, gives us the
ability to extract resources from the Earth and make
new compounds.

49Chapter 4: Chemical bondingThe strong force of attraction between the positive and
negative ions in the ionic crystal lattice results in an ionic
bond. An ionic bond is sometimes called an electrovalent
bond. In an ionic structure, the ions are arranged in a
regular repeating pattern (see Chapter 5). As a result of
this, the force between one ion and the ions of opposite
charge that surround it is very great. In other words, ionic
bonding is very strong.
Dot-and-cross diagrams
You will notice that in Figure 4.2 we used dots and crosses to
show the electronic configuration of the chloride and sodium
ions. This helps us keep track of where the electrons have come
from. It does not mean that the electron transferred is any
different from the others. Diagrams like this are called
dot-and-cross diagrams.
When drawing a dot-and-cross diagram for an ionic
compound it is usually acceptable to draw the outer
electron shell of the metal ion without any electrons. This
is because it has transferred these electrons to the negative
ion. Figure 4.4 shows the outer shell dot-and-cross
diagram for sodium chloride.
A dot-and-cross diagram shows:
■■ the outer electron shells only
■■ that the charge of the ion is spread evenly, by using
square brackets
■■ the charge on each ion, written at the top right-hand corner
of the square brackets.
Some examples of dot-and-cross
diagrams
Magnesium oxide
When magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium
oxide, the two electrons in the outer shell of each magnesium
atom are transferred to the incompletely filled orbitals of
an oxygen atom. By losing two electrons, each magnesium
atom achieves the electronic configuration [2,8] (Figure
4.5). By gaining two electrons, each oxygen atom achieves
the electronic configuration [2,8]. [2,8] is the electronic
configuration of neon; it is a ‘noble-gas configuration’.

Each calcium atom has two electrons in its outer shell, and
these can be transferred to two chlorine atoms. By losing
two electrons, each calcium atom achieves the electronic
configuration [2,8,8] (Figure 4.6). The two chlorine
atoms each gain one electron to achieve the electronic
configuration [2,8,8]. [2,8,8] is the electronic configuration
of argon; it is a ‘noble-gas configuration’.

50Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryCovalent bonding
Single covalent bonds
When two non-metal atoms combine, they share one,
or more, pairs of electrons. A shared pair of electrons
is called a single covalent bond, or a bond pair. A single
covalent bond is represented by a single line between the
atoms: for example, Cl Cl.
You can see that when chlorine atoms combine not all
the electrons are used in bonding. The pairs of outer-shell
electrons not used in bonding are called lone pairs. Each
atom in a chlorine molecule has three lone pairs
of electrons and shares one bonding pair of electrons
(Figure 4.8).

Figure 4.8 Atoms of chlorine share electrons to form a single
covalent bond.
When drawing the arrangement of electrons in a
molecule we:
■■ use a ‘dot’ for electrons from one of the atoms and a ‘cross’
for the electrons from the other atom
■■ if there are more than two types of atom we can use
additional symbols such as a small circle or a small triangle
■■ we draw the outer electrons in pairs, to emphasise the
number of bond pairs and the number of lone pairs.
Some examples of dot-and-cross diagrams for simple
covalently bonded molecules are shown in Figure 4.9.
There are some cases in which the electrons around
a central atom may not have a noble gas configuration.
For example:
■■ boron trifluoride, BF 3 , has only six electrons around
the boron atom; we say that the boron atom is
‘electron deficient’
■■ sulfur hexafluoride, SF6 , has twelve electrons around the
central sulfur atom; we say that the sulfur atom has an
‘expanded octet’ (Figure 4.10).

Multiple covalent bonds
Some atoms can bond together by sharing two pairs of
electrons. We call this a double covalent bond. A double
covalent bond is represented by a double line between the
atoms: for example, O O. The dot-and-cross diagrams
for oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethene, all of which have
double covalent bonds, are shown in Figure 4.11.
■■ In order to form an oxygen molecule, each oxygen atom
needs to gain two electrons to complete its outer shell. So
two pairs of electrons are shared and two covalent bonds
are formed.
■■ For carbon dioxide, each oxygen atom needs to gain two
electrons as before. But the carbon atom needs to gain four
electrons to complete its outer shell. So two oxygen atoms
each form two bonds with carbon, so that the carbon atom
has eight electrons around it.

52Cambridge International AS Level Chemistry■■ In ethene, two hydrogen atoms share a pair of electrons
with each carbon atom. This leaves each carbon atom with
two outer shell electrons for bonding with each other. A
double bond is formed.
Atoms can also bond together by sharing three pairs of
electrons. We call this a triple covalent bond. Figure 4.12
shows a dot-and-cross diagram for the triple-bonded
nitrogen molecule.
In order to form a nitrogen molecule, each nitrogen
atom needs to gain three electrons to complete its outer
shell. So three pairs of electrons are shared and three
covalent bonds are formed.
Co-ordinate bonding
(dative covalent bonding)
A co-ordinate bond (or dative covalent bond) is formed
when one atom provides both the electrons needed for a
covalent bond.
For dative covalent bonding we need:
■■ one atom having a lone pair of electrons
■■ a second atom having an unfilled orbital to accept the lone
pair; in other words, an electron-deficient compound.
An example of this is the ammonium ion, NH4+, formed
when ammonia combines with a hydrogen ion, H+. The
hydrogen ion is electron deficient; it has space for two
electrons in its shell. The nitrogen atom in the ammonia
molecule has a lone pair of electrons. The lone pair on
the nitrogen atom provides both electrons for the bond
(Figure 4.13).
In a displayed formula (which shows all atoms and
bonds), a co-ordinate bond is represented by an arrow.
The head of the arrow points away from the lone pair that
forms the bond.
Another molecule that has co-ordinate bonds is
aluminium chloride. At high temperatures aluminium
chloride exists as molecules with the formula AlCl 3 . This
molecule is electron deficient; it still needs two electrons to
complete the outer shell of the aluminium atom. At lower

53Chapter 4: Chemical bondingtemperatures two molecules of AlCl 3 combine to form a
molecule with the formula Al 2 Cl 6 . The AlCl 3 molecules
are able to combine because lone pairs of electrons on two
of the chlorine atoms form co-ordinate bonds with the
aluminium atoms, as shown in Figure 4.14.
Bond length and bond energy
In general, double bonds are shorter than single bonds.
This is because double bonds have a greater quantity of
negative charge between the two atomic nuclei. The
greater force of attraction between the electrons and the
nuclei pulls the atoms closer together. This results in a
stronger bond. We measure the strength of a bond by
its bond energy. This is the energy needed to break one
mole of a given bond in a gaseous molecule (see also
Chapter 6). Table 4.1 shows some values of bond lengths
and bond energies.
Bond Bond energy / kJ mol–1 Bond length / nm
C C 350 0.154
C C 610 0.134
C O 360 0.143
C O 740 0.116
Table 4.1 Examples of values for bond energies and
bond lengths.
Bond strength can influence the reactivity of a compound.
The molecules in liquids and gases are in random motion
so they are constantly colliding with each other. A reaction
only happens between molecules when a collision occurs
with enough energy to break bonds in either or both
molecules. Nitrogen is unreactive because it has a triple
bond, N N. It takes a lot of energy to break the nitrogen
atoms apart; the bond energy required is 994 kJ mol–1.
Oxygen is much more reactive. Although it has a double
bond, it only takes 496 kJ to break a mole of O O bonds.
However, bond strength is only one factor that influences
the reactivity of a molecule. The polarity of the bond (see
page 61) and whether the bond is a σ bond (sigma bond) or
a π bond (pi bond) (see page 57) both play a large part in
determining chemical reactivity.

Electron-pair repulsion theory
Because all electrons have the same (negative) charge, they
repel each other when they are close together. So, a pair
of electrons in the bonds surrounding the central atom in
a molecule will repel other electron pairs. This repulsion
forces the pairs of electrons apart until the repulsive forces
are minimised.
The shape and bond angles of a covalently bonded
molecule depend on:
■■ the number of pairs of electrons around each atom
■■ whether these pairs are lone pairs or bonding pairs.
Lone pairs of electrons have a more concentrated electron
charge cloud than bonding pairs of electrons. Their
cloud charges are wider and slightly closer to the nucleus
of the central atom. This results in a different amount
of repulsion between different types of electron pairs.
The order of repulsion is lone pair–lone pair (most
repulsion) > lone pair–bond pair > bond pair–bond pair
(least repulsion).
Figure 4.15 shows the repulsions between lone pairs
(pink) and bonding pairs (white) in a water molecule.
Figure 4.15 Repulsion between lone and bonding electron
pairs in water.
Working out the shapes of molecules
The differences in electron-pair repulsion determine the
shape and bond angles in a molecule. Figure 4.16 compares
the shapes and bond angles of methane, ammonia and
water. Space-filling models of these molecules are shown
in Figure 4.17. Each of these molecules has four pairs
of electrons surrounding the central atom. Note that in
drawing three-dimensional diagrams, the triangular
‘wedge’ is the bond coming towards you and the dashed
black line is the bond going away from you.

55Chapter 4: Chemical bonding■■ Ammonia has three bonding pairs of electrons and one lone
pair. As lone pair–bond pair repulsion is greater than bond
pair–bond pair repulsion, the bonding pairs of electrons are
pushed closer together. This gives the ammonia molecule
a triangular pyramidal shape. The H N H bond angle is
about 107°.
■■ Water has two bonding pairs of electrons and two lone
pairs. The greatest electron pair repulsion is between the
two lone pairs. This results in the bonds being pushed even
closer together. The shape of the water molecule is a nonlinear V shape. The H O H bond angle is 104.5°.

We can work out the shapes of other molecules by
following the rules for electron-pair repulsion.
Boron trifluoride
Boron trifluoride is an electron-deficient molecule. It
has only six electrons in its outer shell. The three
bonding pairs of electrons repel each other equally, so the
F B F bond angles are 120° (Figure 4.18). We describe
the shape of the molecule as trigonal planar. ‘Trigonal’
means ‘having three angles’.

Carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide has two carbon–oxygen double bonds
and no lone pairs. The four electrons in each double bond
repel other electrons in a similar way to the two electrons
in a single bond (Figure 4.19). So, the O C O bond angle
is 180°. We describe the shape of the carbon dioxide
molecule as linear.
Phosphorus pentafluoride
Phosphorus pentafluoride has five bonding pairs of
electrons and no lone pairs. The repulsion between the
electron pairs results in the most stable structure being
a trigonal bipyramid (Figure 4.20). Three of the fluorine
atoms lie in the same plane as the phosphorus atom. The
bond angles FPF within this plane are 120°. Two of the
fluorine atoms lie above and below this plane at 90° to it.

56Cambridge International AS Level Chemistryσ bonds and π bonds
A single covalent bond is formed when two non-metal
atoms combine. Each atom that combines has an atomic
orbital containing a single unpaired electron. In the
formation of a covalent bond the atomic orbitals overlap
so that a combined orbital is formed, containing two
electrons. We call this combined orbital a molecular
orbital. The amount of overlap of the atomic orbitals
determines the strength of the bond: the greater the
overlap, the stronger the bond. Figure 4.22 shows how the
s atomic orbitals of two hydrogen atoms overlap to form a
covalent bond.
+

Figure 4.22 Two 1s atomic orbitals in hydrogen overlap to
form a covalent bond.
The p atomic orbitals can also overlap linearly (end-on)
to form covalent bonds. When p orbitals are involved in
forming single bonds, they become modified to include
some s orbital character. The orbital is slightly altered
in shape to make one of the lobes of the p orbital bigger.
The process of mixing atomic orbitals (for example
one s orbital and three p orbitals) in this way is called
hybridisation. The hybrids are called sp3 hybrids. In sp3
hybrids, each orbital has 1_
4 s character and 3_
4 p character.
When one s orbital and two p orbitals are hybridised,
the hybrids are called sp2 hybrids. When one s orbital and
one p orbital are hybridised, the hybrids are called
sp orbitals. When hybridised orbitals overlap linearly
(end-on) we call the bond a σ bond (sigma bond).

Figure 4.23 Bonds are formed by the linear (end-on) overlap
of atomic orbitals.
The electron density of each σ bond is symmetrical about a
line joining the nuclei of the atoms forming the bond.
Bonds formed by the sideways overlap of p orbitals are
called π bonds (pi bonds). A π bond is not symmetrical
about the axes joining the nuclei of the atoms forming the
bond. Figure 4.24 shows how a π bond is formed from two
p orbitals overlapping sideways.
We often draw a single π bond as two electron clouds,
one arising from each lobe of the p orbitals. You must
remember, though, that the two clouds of electrons in
a π bond represent one bond consisting of a total of
two electrons.

on the other carbon atom. This forms a π bond. Figure

Ethene is a planar molecule because this ensures the
maximum overlap of the p orbitals that form the π bond.
You will notice that the electron clouds that make up the
π bond lie above and below the plane of the carbon and
hydrogen nuclei. We would expect the H C H bond
angle in ethene to be about 120° because the three areas
of electron density of the σ bonds are equally distributed.
However, because of the position of the π bond, this bond
angle is actually 117°. This minimises the repulsive forces.
Metallic bonding
What is a metallic bond?
Figure 4.28 Metals, clockwise from top left: sodium, gold,
mercury, magnesium and copper.
58Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryIn a metal, the atoms are packed closely together in a
regular arrangement called a lattice. Metal atoms in a
lattice tend to lose their outer shell electrons and become
positive ions. The outer shell electrons occupy new energy
levels and are free to move throughout the metal lattice.
We call these electrons delocalised electrons (mobile
electrons). Delocalised electrons are electrons that are not
associated with any one particular atom or bond.
Metallic bonding is strong. This is because the ions
are held together by the strong electrostatic attraction
between their positive charges and the negative charges of
the delocalised electrons (Figure 4.29). This electrostatic
attraction acts in all directions. The strength of metallic
bonding increases with:
■■ increasing positive charge on the ions in the metal lattice
■■ decreasing size of metal ions in the lattice
■■ increasing number of mobile electrons per atom.
Metallic bonding and the properties of
metals
We can use our model of metallic bonding to explain
many of the properties of metals.
Most metals have high melting points and
high boiling points
It takes a lot of energy to weaken the strong attractive
forces between the metal ions and the delocalised
electrons. These attractive forces can only be overcome
at high temperatures. However, mercury is a liquid at
room temperature (Figure 4.30). This is because some of
the electrons in a mercury atom are bound more tightly
than usual to the nucleus, weakening the metallic bonds
between atoms.
Figure 4.30 Mercury is a liquid at room temperature.
Metals conduct electricity
When a voltage is applied to a piece of metal, an electric
current flows in it because the delocalised electrons
(mobile electrons) are free to move. Metallic bonding is
the only type of bonding that allows us to predict reliably
that a solid will conduct electricity. Covalent solids cannot
conduct electricity because none of their electrons are free
to move, although graphite is an exception to this. Ionic
solids cannot conduct because neither their electrons nor
their ions are free to move.

59Chapter 4: Chemical bondingMetals conduct heat
The conduction of heat is partly due to the movement of
the delocalised electrons and partly due to the vibrations
passed on from one metal ion to the next.
Intermolecular forces
The forces within molecules due to covalent bonding are
strong. However, the forces between molecules are much
weaker. We call these forces intermolecular forces.
There are three types of intermolecular force:
■■ van der Waals’ forces (which are also called dispersion
forces and temporary dipole–induced dipole forces)
■■ permanent dipole–dipole forces
■■ hydrogen bonding.
Table 4.2 compares the relative strength of these
intermolecular forces and other bonds.

hydrogen bonding 20–50
permanent dipole–dipole force 5–20
van der Waals’ forces 1–20
Table 4.2 Strengths of different types of bond and
intermolecular force.
In order to understand how intermolecular forces
work, we first have to know about electronegativity and
bond polarity.
Figure 4.31 The intermolecular forces in water allow some
insects to skate over its surface.
Electronegativity
Electronegativity is the ability of a particular atom, which
is covalently bonded to another atom, to attract the bond
pair of electrons towards itself.
The greater the value of the electronegativity, the greater
the power of an atom to attract the electrons in a covalent
bond towards itself. For Groups 1 to 17 the pattern of
electronegativity is:
■■ electronegativity increases across a period from Group 1 to
Group 17
■■ electronegativity increases up each group.
This means that fluorine is the most electronegative
element.
For the most electronegative elements, the order of
electronegativity is:
increasing electronegativity
Br < Cl < N < O < F
Carbon and hydrogen have electronegativities that are
lower than those of most other non-metallic elements.
Polarity in molecules
When the electronegativity values of the two atoms
forming a covalent bond are the same, the pair of electrons
is equally shared. We say that the covalent bond is
non-polar. For example, hydrogen (H 2), chlorine (Cl 2) and
bromine (Br2) are non-polar molecules.
When a covalent bond is formed between two atoms
having different electronegativity values, the more
electronegative atom attracts the pair of electrons in the
bond towards it.

60Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryAs a result:
■■ the centre of positive charge does not coincide with the
centre of negative charge
■■ we say that the electron distribution is asymmetric
■■ the two atoms are partially charged
■■ we show
– the less electronegative atom with the partial charge δ+
(‘delta positive’)
– the more electronegative atom with the partial charge
δ– (‘delta negative’)
■■ we say that the bond is polar (or that it has a dipole).
Figure 4.32 shows the polar bond in a hydrogen
chloride molecule.

ClH
Figure 4.32 Hydrogen chloride is a polar molecule.
As the difference in electronegativity values of the atoms
in a covalent bond increases, the bond becomes more
polar. The degree of polarity of a molecule is measured as a
dipole moment. The direction of the dipole is shown by the
sign . The arrow points to the partially negatively
charged end of the dipole.
In molecules containing more than two atoms, we have
to take into account:
■■ the polarity of each bond
■■ the arrangement of the bonds in the molecule.
Trichloromethane, CHCl 3 , is a polar molecule. The
three C Cl dipoles point in a similar direction. Their
combined effect is not cancelled out by the polarity of the
C H bond. This is because the C H bond is virtually
non-polar. The electron distribution is asymmetric. The
molecule is polar, with the negative end towards the
chlorine atoms. This is shown in Figure 4.33a.

Some molecules contain polar bonds but have no overall
polarity. This is because the polar bonds in these molecules
are arranged in such a fashion that the dipole moments
cancel each other out. An example is tetrachloromethane,
CCl4 (Figure 4.33b). Tetrachloromethane has four polar
C Cl bonds pointing towards the four corners of a
tetrahedron. The dipoles in each bond cancel each other.
So, tetrachloromethane is non-polar.
The charge distribution in molecules and ions can be
determined by a method called X-ray spectroscopy. One
method involves firing X-rays at molecules and measuring
the energy of the electrons given off. Using this method,
scientists have found that in a sulfate ion, the sulfur atom
has a charge of +1.12 units and the four oxygen atoms each
have a charge of –0.78 units.
Polarity and chemical reactivity
Bond polarity influences chemical reactivity. For example,
both nitrogen, N N, and carbon monoxide, C O, have
triple bonds requiring a similar amount of energy to
break them. Nitrogen is a non-polar molecule and is fairly
unreactive. But carbon monoxide is a polar molecule, and
this explains its reactivity with oxygen and its use as a
reducing agent. Many chemical reactions are started by a
reagent attacking one of the electrically charged ends of a
polar molecule. For example, chloroethane, C2 H5 Cl, is far
more reactive than ethane, C2 H6 . This is because reagents
such as OH– ions can attack the delta-positive carbon atom
of the polarised C Cl bond (see also page 220).

Such an attack is not possible with ethane because the
C H bond is virtually non-polar. This helps to explain
why alkanes, such as ethane, are not very reactive.

61Chapter 4: Chemical bondingvan der Waals’ forces
Noble gases such as neon and argon exist as isolated atoms.
Noble gases can be liquefied, but at very low temperatures,
so there must be very weak forces of attraction between
their atoms. These weak forces keep the atoms together in
the liquid state.
Bromine is a non-polar molecule that is liquid at
room temperature. The weak forces of attraction are
keeping the bromine molecules together at room
temperature. These very weak forces of attraction are
called van der Waals’ forces. van der Waals’ forces exist
between all atoms or molecules. So, how do van der
Waals’ forces arise?
The electron charge clouds in a non-polar molecule
(or atom) are constantly moving. It often happens that
more of the charge cloud is on one side of the molecule
than the other. This means that one end of the molecule
has, for a short moment, more negative charge than the
other. A temporary dipole is set up. This dipole can set up
(induce) a dipole on neighbouring molecules. As a result
of this, there are forces of attraction between the δ+ end
of the dipole in one molecule and the δ– end of the dipole
in a neighbouring molecule (Figure 4.34). These dipoles
are always temporary because the electrons clouds are
always moving. van der Waals’ forces are sometimes called
temporary dipole–induced dipole forces.
van der Waals’ forces increase with
■■ increasing number of electrons (and protons) in the molecule
■■ increasing the number of contact points between the
molecules – contact points are places where the molecules
come close together.
Differences in the size of the van der Waals’ forces can
be used to explain the trend in the enthalpy change of
vaporisation and boiling points of the noble gases. Figure
4.35 shows how these vary with the number of electrons
present. (The enthalpy change of vaporisation is the energy
required to convert a mole of liquid into a mole of gas.)
You can see that both the enthalpy change of vaporisation
and the boiling points of the noble gases increase as the
number of electrons increases. This is because the van
der Waals’ forces between the atoms are increased with
an increasing number of electrons. So, more energy is
needed to change the liquid into vapour and the boiling
point is higher.
The effect of increasing the number of contact points
can be seen by comparing the boiling points of pentane
(boiling point 36 °C) and 2,2-dimethylpropane (boiling
point 10 °C) (Figure 4.36). These compounds have equal
numbers of electrons in their molecules.
The molecules in pentane can line up beside each other
so there are a large number of contact points. The van der
Waals’ forces are higher, so the boiling point is higher.
The molecules of 2,2-dimethylpropane are more compact.
The surface area available for coming into contact with
neighbouring molecules is smaller. The van der Waals’
forces are relatively lower, so the boiling point is lower.
The van der Waals’ forces between individual atoms are very
small. However, the total van der Waals’ forces between very
long non-polar molecules such as poly(ethene) molecules (see
page 211) can be much larger. That is why poly(ethene) is a
solid at room temperature.

crystalline and non-crystalline regions in them (Figure 4.37).

Figure 4.37 Crystalline and non-crystalline regions
in poly(ethene).
HDPE has more crystalline regions where the molecules
are closer together than LDPE. The total van der Waals’
forces are greater, so HDPE is the stronger of the two.
Permanent dipole–dipole forces
In some molecules, the dipole is permanent. Molecules
with a permanent dipole are called polar molecules. A
fine jet of polar molecules will be attracted towards an
electrically charged plastic rod or comb. (The rod can be
charged by rubbing it with a woollen cloth.) Figure 4.38
shows the result of this experiment.
The molecules are always attracted to the charged
rod, whether it is positively or negatively charged. This is
because the molecules have both negatively and positively
charged ends.
The forces between two molecules having permanent
dipoles are called permanent dipole–dipole forces.
The attractive force between the δ+ charge on one
molecule and the δ– charge on a neighbouring
molecule causes a weak attractive force between the
molecules (Figure 4.39).

For small molecules with the same number of electrons,
permanent dipole–dipole forces are often stronger
than van der Waals’ forces. For example, propanone
(CH 3COCH 3, Mr = 58) has a higher boiling point than
butane (CH 3CH 2CH 2CH 3, Mr = 58) (Figure 4.40).
This means that more energy is needed to break the
intermolecular forces between propanone molecules than
between butane molecules.

Figure 4.40 The difference in the boiling points of propanone
and butane can be explained by the different types of
intermolecular force between the molecules.
The permanent dipole–dipole forces between propanone
molecules are strong enough to make this substance a liquid
at room temperature. There are only van der Waals’ forces
between butane molecules. These forces are comparatively
weak, so butane is a gas at room temperature.
Hydrogen bonding
Hydrogen bonding is the strongest type of intermolecular
force. For hydrogen bonding to occur between two
molecules we need:
■■ one molecule having a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to
F, O or N (the three most electronegative atoms)
■■ a second molecule having a F, O or N atom with an available
lone pair of electrons.
When a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a very
electronegative atom, the bond is very highly polarised.
The δ+ charge on the hydrogen atom is high enough for
a bond to be formed with a lone pair of electrons on the
F, O or N atom of a neighbouring molecule (Figure 4.41).
The force of attraction is about one-tenth of the strength
of a normal covalent bond. For maximum bond strength,
the angle between the covalent bond to the hydrogen atom
and the hydrogen bond is usually 180°.

Figure 4.41 Hydrogen bonding between two ammonia
molecules. A hydrogen bond is represented by a line of dots.
The average number of hydrogen bonds formed per
molecule depends on:
■■ the number of hydrogen atoms attached to F, O or N in
the molecule
■■ the number of lone pairs present on the F, O or N.
Water has two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs per
molecule (Figure 4.42). So water is extensively hydrogen
bonded with other water molecules. It has an average of
two hydrogen bonds per molecule.

Ammonia is less extensively hydrogen bonded than
water (see Figure 4.41). It can form, on average, only one
hydrogen bond per molecule. Although each ammonia
molecule has three hydrogen atoms attached to the
nitrogen atom, it has only one lone pair of electrons that
can be involved in hydrogen bond formation.
11 Bromine, Br 2 , and iodine monochloride, ICl, have the
same number of electrons. But the boiling point of
iodine monochloride is nearly 40 °C higher than the
boiling point of bromine. Explain this difference.

64Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryHow does hydrogen bonding affect
boiling point?
Some compounds may have higher boiling points than
expected. This can be due to hydrogen bonding. Figure
4.43 shows a graph of the boiling points of the hydrogen
halides, HF, HCl, HBr and HI, plotted against the position
of the halogen in the Periodic Table.

Boiling point / °C

Figure 4.43 The boiling points of the hydrogen halides.
The rise in boiling point from HCl to HI is due to the
increasing number of electrons in the halogen atoms as we
go down the group. This leads to increased van der Waals’
forces as the molecules get bigger. If hydrogen fluoride
only had van der Waals’ forces between its molecules,
we would expect its boiling point to be about –90 °C.
However, the boiling point of hydrogen fluoride is 20 °C,
which is much higher. This is because of the stronger
intermolecular forces of hydrogen bonding between the
HF molecules.
The peculiar properties of water
1 Enthalpy change of vaporisation and
boiling point
Water has a much higher enthalpy change of vaporisation
and boiling point than expected.
This is due to its extensive hydrogen bonding. Figure
4.44 shows the enthalpy changes of vaporisation of water
and other Group 16 hydrides.
The rise in enthalpy change of vaporisation from H 2 S
to H 2 Te is due to the increasing number of electrons in
the Group 16 atoms as we go down the group. This leads
to increased van der Waals’ forces as the molecules get
bigger. If water only had van der Waals’ forces between
its molecules, we would expect its enthalpy change to be
about 17 kJ mol–1. But the enthalpy change of vaporisation
of water is much higher. This is because water is
extensively hydrogen bonded. The boiling point of water
is also much higher than predicted by the trend in boiling
points for the other Group 16 hydrides. This also indicates
that much more energy is required to break the bonds
between water molecules compared with other hydrides of
Group 16 elements.

2 Surface tension and viscosity
Water has a high surface tension and high viscosity.
Hydrogen bonding reduces the ability of water
molecules to slide over each other, so the viscosity of
water is high. The hydrogen bonds in water also exert a
significant downward force at the surface of the liquid.
This causes the surface tension of water to be higher than
for most liquids.

65Chapter 4: Chemical bonding3 Ice is less dense than water
Most solids are denser than their liquids. This is
because the molecules are more closely packed in the
solid state. But this is not true of water. In ice, there is a
three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network of water
molecules. This produces a rigid lattice in which each
oxygen atom is surrounded by a tetrahedron of hydrogen
atoms. This ‘more open’ arrangement, due to the relatively
long hydrogen bonds, allows the water molecules to be
slightly further apart than in the liquid (Figure 4.46). So
the density of ice is less than that of liquid water.
Figure 4.45 Ice floats on water.
Figure 4.46 A model of ice. Oxygen atoms are red, hydrogen
atoms are white, hydrogen bonds are lilac. This hydrogenbonded arrangement makes ice less dense than water.
Bonding and physical
properties
The type of bonding between atoms, ions or molecules
influences the physical properties of a substance.
Physical state at room temperature and
pressure
Ionic compounds
Ionic compounds are solids at room temperature and
pressure. This is because:
■■ there are strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds) holding
the positive and negative ions together
■■ the ions are regularly arranged in a lattice (see Chapter 5),
with the oppositely charged ions close to each other.
Ionic compounds have high melting points, high boiling
points and high enthalpy changes of vaporisation. It
takes a lot of energy to overcome the strong electrostatic
attractive forces.
Metals
Metals, apart from mercury, are solids. Most metals have
high melting points, high boiling points and high enthalpy
changes of vaporisation. This is because it takes a lot of
energy to overcome the strong attractive forces between
the positive ions and the ‘sea’ of delocalised electrons.
Covalent compounds
Covalently bonded substances with a simple molecular
structure, for example water and ammonia, are usually
liquids or gases. This is because the forces between the
molecules are weak. It does not take much energy to
overcome these intermolecular forces, so these substances
have low melting points, low boiling points and low
enthalpy changes of vaporisation compared with ionic
compounds. Some substances that have covalently bonded
molecules may be solids at room temperature, for example
iodine and poly(ethene). These are usually molecules
where the van der Waals’ forces are considerable. However,
the melting points of these substances are still fairly low
compared with ionic compounds or most metals.
Solubility
Ionic compounds
Most ionic compounds are soluble in water. This is because
water molecules are polar and they are attracted to the
ions on the surface of the ionic solid. These attractions
are called ion–dipole attractions (see page 265). These
66Cambridge International AS Level Chemistryattractions replace the electrostatic forces between the ions
and the ions go into solution.
Metals
Metals do not dissolve in water. However, some metals, for
example sodium and calcium, react with water.
Covalent compounds
Covalently bonded substances with a simple molecular
structure fall into two groups.
■■ Those that are insoluble in water. Most covalently bonded
molecules are non-polar. Water molecules are not attracted
to them so they are insoluble. An example is iodine.
■■ Those that are soluble in water. Small molecules that can
form hydrogen bonds with water are generally soluble. An
example is ethanol, C 2H5 OH.
Some covalently bonded substances react with water rather
than dissolving in it. For example, hydrogen chloride
reacts with water to form hydrogen ions and chloride ions,
and the ions are soluble. Silicon chloride reacts with water
to form hydrogen ions, chloride ions and silicon dioxide.
This reaction is called a hydrolysis reaction.
Electrical conductivity
Ionic compounds
Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity when in the
solid state. This is because the ions are fixed in the lattice
and can only vibrate around a fixed point. When molten,
an ionic compound conducts electricity because the ions
are mobile.
Metals
Metals conduct electricity both when solid and when
molten. This is because the delocalised electrons are
mobile.
Covalent compounds
Covalently bonded substances with a simple molecular
structure do not conduct electricity. This is because they
have neither ions nor electrons that are mobile.
14 Explain the following differences in terms of the type
of bonding present.
a Aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2980 °C but
aluminium chloride changes to a vapour at 178 °C.
b Magnesium chloride conducts electricity when
molten but not when solid.
c Iron conducts electricity when solid but the ionic
solid iron(II) chloride does not conduct when solid.
d Sodium sulfate dissolves in water but sulfur
does not.
e Propanol, CH3 CH2CH2OH, is soluble in water but
propane, CH3 CH2CH3 , is not.
f A solution of hydrogen chloride in water
conducts electricity.

Summary
■ Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons.
■ Ionic (electrovalent) bonding involves an
attractive force between positively and negatively
charged ions in an ionic lattice.
■ A covalent bond is formed when atoms share a pair
of electrons.
■ When atoms form covalent or ionic bonds each atom
or ion has a full outer electron shell of electrons.
(Some covalent compounds may be electron
deficient or have an ‘expanded octet’.)
■ Dot-and-cross diagrams can be drawn to show
the arrangement of electrons in ionic and
covalent compounds.
■ In dative covalent bonding one atom provides both
electrons in the formation of the covalent bond.
■ The shapes and bond angles in molecules can be
predicted using the idea that lone pairs of electrons
repel other lone pairs more than bond pair electrons,
and that bond pair to bond pair repulsion is least.
■ σ bonds (sigma bonds) are formed by end-on
overlap of atomic orbitals, whereas π bonds (pi
bonds) are formed by sideways overlap of p-type
atomic orbitals.
■ Three types of relatively weak intermolecular forces
are hydrogen bonding, permanent dipole–dipole
forces and van der Waals’ forces.
67Chapter 4: Chemical bonding■ Electronegativity differences can be used to
predict the type of weak intermolecular forces
between molecules.
■ Hydrogen bonding occurs between molecules that
have a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an atom
of a very electronegative element (fluorine, oxygen
or nitrogen).
■ The reactivities of covalent bonds can be
explained in terms of bond energy, bond length
and bond polarity.
■ Intermolecular forces are based on either permanent
dipoles, as in CHCl 3(l), or temporary induced dipoles
(van der Waals’ forces), as in Br 2(l).
■ Metallic bonding can be explained in terms
of a lattice of positive ions surrounded by
mobile electrons.
■ The physical properties of substances may be
predicted from the type of bonding present.
■ Substances with ionic bonding have high melting
and boiling points, whereas simple molecules with
covalent bonding have low melting points.
■ The presence of hydrogen bonding in a molecule
influences its melting point and boiling point.

Gases have no fixed shape or volume. Gas particles:
■■ are far apart, therefore gases can be compressed
■■ are randomly arranged
■■ can move freely from place to place, in all directions.
Liquids take the shape of the container they occupy.
Liquid particles:
■■ are close together, so liquids have a fixed volume and can
only be compressed slightly
■■ are arranged fairly randomly
■■ have limited movement from place to place, in all directions.
Solids have a fixed shape and volume. Solid particles:
■■ are touching each other, so solids cannot be compressed
■■ are usually in a regular arrangement
■■ cannot change positions with each other – they can
only vibrate.
The state of a substance at room temperature and pressure
depends on its structure and bonding. Five types of
structure are found in elements and compounds:
■■ simple atomic, e.g. argon
■■ simple molecular, e.g. carbon dioxide
■■ giant ionic, e.g. sodium chloride
■■ giant metallic, e.g. iron
■■ giant molecular, e.g. silicon(IV) oxide.
The simple atomic structures found in the noble gases
generally have similar physical properties to simple
molecular gases.
The gaseous state
The kinetic theory of gases
The idea that molecules in gases are in constant movement
is called the kinetic theory of gases. This theory makes
certain assumptions:
■■ the gas molecules move rapidly and randomly
■■ the distance between the gas molecules is much greater
than the diameter of the molecules so the volume of the
molecules is negligible
■■ there are no forces of attraction or repulsion between
the molecules
■■ all collisions between particles are elastic – this means
no kinetic energy is lost in collisions (kinetic energy is the
energy associated with moving particles)
Introduction
In the last chapter we looked at the types of forces that
keep the particles in solids and liquids together and
make it possible to liquefy gases. In this chapter, we
shall also consider how the closeness and motion of
the particles influences the properties of these three
states of matter (Figure 5.1).
Figure 5.1 The three states of water are ice, water and steam. The ‘steam’ we see from the kettle is condensed droplets of
water. The real gaseous water is in the area between this condensation and the spout of the kettle. We can’t see it because
it is colourless.

motion of the particles when:
a a solid changes to a liquid
b a liquid changes to a gas.
QuestIon
73Chapter 5: States of matter■■ the temperature of the gas is related to the average kinetic
energy of the molecules.
A theoretical gas that fits this description is called an
ideal gas. In reality, the gases we encounter don’t fit this
description exactly, although they may come very close.
The gases we encounter are called real gases.
Noble gases with small atoms, such as helium and
neon, approach ideal gas behaviour. This is because the
intermolecular forces are so small.
Ideal gases
The volume that a gas occupies depends on:
■■ its pressure; we measure pressure in pascals, Pa
■■ its temperature; we measure temperatures of gases in
kelvin, K.
The kelvin temperature equals the Celsius temperature
plus 273. For example, 100 °C is 100 + 273 = 373 K.
Gases in a container exert a pressure. This is because the gas
molecules are constantly hitting the walls of the container.
If we decrease the volume of a gas (at constant temperature)
the molecules are squashed closer together and hit the
walls of the container more often. So the pressure of the gas
increases (Figure 5.2a). A graph of volume of gas plotted
against 1/pressure gives a proportional relationship (as
shown by the straight line in Figure 5.2b). We say that the
volume is inversely proportional to the pressure.
When a gas is heated at constant pressure its volume
increases (Figure 5.3a). This is because the particles move
faster and hit the walls of the container with greater force. If
the pressure is to be constant the molecules must get further
apart. The volume of a gas at constant pressure is proportional
to its temperature measured in kelvin (Figure 5.3b).

helium and neon are very small.

Figure 5.2 a As the volume of a gas decreases, its pressure increases due to the increased frequency of the gas molecules hitting

74Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryAn ideal gas will have a volume that varies exactly in
proportion to its temperature and exactly in inverse
proportion to its pressure.
Limitations of the ideal gas laws
Scientists have taken accurate measurements to show how
the volumes of gases change with temperature and pressure.
These show us that gases do not always behave exactly as we
expect an ideal gas to behave. This is because real gases do
not always obey the kinetic theory in two ways:
■■ there is not zero attraction between the molecules
■■ we cannot ignore the volume of the molecules themselves.
These differences are especially noticeable at very
high pressures and very low temperatures. Under
these conditions:
■■ the molecules are close to each other
■■ the volume of the molecules is not negligible compared with
the volume of the container
■■ there are van der Waals’ or dipole–dipole forces of
attraction between the molecules
■■ attractive forces pull the molecules towards each other and
away from the walls of the container
■■ the pressure is lower than expected for an ideal gas
■■ the effective volume of the gas is smaller than expected for
an ideal gas.
The general gas equation
For an ideal gas, we can combine the laws about how the
volume of a gas depends on temperature and pressure.
We also know from page 18 that the volume of a gas is
proportional to the number of moles present. Putting all
these together, gives us the general gas equation:
pV = nRT
p is the pressure in pascals, Pa
V is the volume of gas in cubic metres, m 3
(1 m 3 = 1000 dm 3)
n is the number of moles of gas ( n = m___
Mr )
R is the gas constant, which has a value of 8.31 J K–1 mol–1
T is the temperature in kelvin, K.

gas equation
If we know any four of the five physical quantities in the
general gas equation, we can calculate the fifth.

performed in sealed glass tubes that do not melt
at high temperatures. The tubes have thin walls

gases to explain why the tubes should not be heated

75Chapter 5: States of matterCalculating relative molecular masses
An accurate method of finding the relative molecular mass
of a substance is to use a mass spectrometer (see Chapter 1).
A less accurate method, but one that is suitable for a school
laboratory, is to use the general gas equation to find the mass
of gas in a large flask. As the number of moles is the mass of a
substance divided by its relative molecular mass, we can find
the relative molecular mass of a gas by simply substituting in
the general gas equation. Although weighing gases is a
difficult process because they are so light and the buoyancy
of the air has to be taken into account, the method can give
reasonable results.
This method can also be applied to find the relative
molecular mass of a volatile liquid. The volatile liquid
is injected into a gas syringe placed in a syringe oven
(Figure 5.4). The liquid vaporises and the volume of the
vapour is recorded.
The procedure is:
1 put a gas syringe in the syringe oven and leave until the
temperature is constant
2 record the volume of air in the gas syringe

The liquid state
The behaviour of liquids
When we heat a solid:
■■ the energy transferred to the solid makes the particles
vibrate more vigorously
■■ the forces of attraction between the particles weaken
■■ the solid changes to a liquid when its temperature is
sufficiently high.
We call this change of state melting.
For ionic compounds, a high temperature is needed
because ionic bonding is very strong. For molecular
solids, a lower temperature is needed, just enough to
overcome the weak intermolecular forces between
the particles.
The particles in a liquid are still close to each other but
they have enough kinetic energy to keep sliding past each
other in a fairly random way. They do not move freely as
gas particles do. For brief periods, the particles in liquids
are arranged in a slightly ordered way. But this order is
always being broken up when the particles gain kinetic
energy from neighbouring particles.
When we cool a liquid, the particles:
■■ lose kinetic energy so they do not move around so readily
■■ experience increasing forces of attraction
■■ stop sliding past each other when the temperature is
sufficiently low; the liquid solidifies.
We call this change of state freezing.
Vaporisation and vapour pressure
When we heat a liquid:
■■ the energy transferred to the liquid makes the particles
move faster
■■ the forces of attraction between the particles weaken
■■ the particles with most energy are the first to escape from
the forces holding them together in the liquid
■■ the liquid evaporates – this happens at a temperature below
the boiling point
■■ the forces weaken enough for all the particles to become
completely free from each other; they move fast and
randomly and they spread out
■■ the liquid boils; this happens at the boiling point.
This change from the liquid state to the gas state is called
vaporisation. The energy required to change one mole
of liquid to one mole of gas is called the enthalpy change
of vaporisation.
When we cool a vapour, the particles:
■■ lose kinetic energy so the molecules move around
less quickly
■■ experience increasing forces of attraction
■■ move more slowly and become closer together when the
temperature is sufficiently low; the gas liquefies.
We call this change of state condensation.
These changes in state are reversible. Water can be
boiled to form steam, and steam can be condensed to
form liquid water. These changes involve opposite energy
transfers. For example: energy has to be transferred to
water to boil it to form steam. But when steam condenses
to form water, energy is transferred from the steam.
If we put some water in an open beaker, it evaporates
until none is left. But what happens when we allow water
to evaporate in a closed container?
At first, water molecules escape from the surface of the
liquid to become vapour (Figure 5.5a). As more and more
molecules escape, the molecules in the vapour become
closer together. Eventually the molecules with lower
kinetic energy will not be able to overcome the attractive
forces of neighbouring molecules. The vapour begins to
condense. So some water molecules return to the liquid
(Figure 5.5b). Eventually, water molecules return to the
liquid at the same rate as water molecules escape to the

b As more molecules move from liquid to vapour, some begin

At equilibrium the concentration of water molecules in the
vapour remains constant.
equal rate of movement
water molecules in liquid water molecules in vapour
In this situation the pressure exerted by a vapour in
equilibrium with its liquid is called its vapour pressure.
The vapour pressure is caused by the gas particles hitting
the walls of the container. Vapour pressure will increase
when the temperature increases because:
■■ the gas particles have more kinetic energy
■■ the gas particles move faster, so are able to overcome
intermolecular forces of attraction more easily.
The temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to
the atmospheric pressure is the boiling point of the liquid.
The solid state
Many ionic, metallic and covalent compounds are
crystalline. The regular structure of crystals is due to the
regular packing of the particles within the crystal. We call
this regularly repeating arrangement of ions, atoms or
molecules a crystal lattice.
Ionic lattices
Ionic lattices have a three-dimensional arrangement of
alternating positive and negative ions. Compounds with
ionic lattices are sometimes called giant ionic structures.
The type of lattice formed depends on the relative sizes
of the ions present. The ionic lattices for sodium chloride
and magnesium oxide are cubic. In sodium chloride,
each sodium ion is surrounded by six oppositely charged
chloride ions. The chloride ions are much larger than the
sodium ions. The sodium ions fit into the spaces between
the chloride ions so that they are as close as possible to
them (Figure 5.6).

Figure 5.6 The arrangement of the ions in sodium chloride:
a the actual packing of the ions; b an ‘exploded’ view so that
you can see the arrangement of the ions clearly.
Magnesium oxide has the same lattice structure as sodium
chloride. Magnesium ions replace sodium ions and the
oxide ions replace the chloride ions.
The properties of ionic compounds reflect their
structure as well as their bonding.
■■ They are hard. It takes a lot of energy to scratch the
surface because of the strong attractive forces keeping the
ions together.
■■ They are brittle. Ionic crystals may split apart when hit in
the same direction as the layers of ions. The layers of ions
may be displaced by the force of the blow so that ions with
the same charge come together. The repulsions between
thousands of ions in the layers, all with the same charge,
cause the crystal to split along these cleavage planes.
■■ They have high melting points and high boiling points
because the attraction between the large numbers of
oppositely charged ions in the lattice acts in all directions
and bonds them strongly together. The melting points
and boiling points increase with the charge density on the
ions. So magnesium oxide, Mg 2+ O2– , has a higher melting
point (2852 °C) than sodium chloride, Na + Cl – (801 °C).
This is because there is a greater electrostatic attraction
between doubly charged ions than singly charged ions of
similar size.
■■ Many of them are soluble in water (see page 265).
■■ They only conduct electricity when molten or in solution
(see page 67).
8 Bromine is a reddish-brown liquid. Some liquid
bromine is placed in a closed jar. The bromine starts
to evaporate. The colour of the vapour above the
liquid bromine becomes darker and darker. After a
time the bromine vapour does not get any darker.
Use ideas about moving particles to explain
these observations.
QuestIon
78Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryMetallic lattices
In Chapter 4, we learnt that a metallic lattice consists of
ions surrounded by a sea of electrons. The ions are often
packed in hexagonal layers or in a cubic arrangement.
When a force is applied, the layers can slide over each
other. But in a metallic bond, the attractive forces between
the metal ions and the delocalised electrons act in all
directions. So when the layers slide, new metallic bonds
are easily re-formed between ions in new lattice positions
and the delocalised electrons (Figure 5.8). The delocalised
electrons continue to hold the ions in the lattice together.
The metal now has a different shape. This explains why
metals are malleable (they can be hammered into different
shapes) and ductile (they can be drawn into wires). The
high tensile strength and hardness of most metals is also
due to the strong attractive forces between the metal ions
and the delocalised electrons.

Alloys and their properties
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals or a metal
with a non-metal. The metal added to create the alloy
becomes part of the crystal lattice of the other metal.
Brass is an alloy of copper (70%) with zinc (30%).
It is stronger than copper but still malleable. For these
reasons it is used for musical instruments, ornaments and
household items such as door handles.
But why is brass stronger than pure copper?
Zinc ions are larger than copper ions. The presence
of different-sized metal ions makes the arrangement of
the lattice less regular. This stops the layers of ions from
sliding over each other so easily when a force is applied
(Figure 5.10).

Figure 5.10 The layers of ions in an alloy slide less easily

Pure aluminium is soft, ductile and has high electrical and
thermal conductivity. Because of its low strength, pure
aluminium is of little use in engineering. But its strength
can be increased by addition of other elements such as
copper, magnesium, silicon and manganese. Many alloys
of aluminium are lightweight, strong and resistant to
corrosion. These are used for the bodies of aircraft, for the

layers of ions in the crystal.

corrosion resistance is important.
Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. A 33-metre high
bronze statue was built near the harbour in Rhodes (Greece)
over 2000 years ago. The statue fell down after an earthquake
and was eventually bought by a Syrian merchant. The bronze
was recycled to make useful implements.
Simple molecular lattices
Substances with a simple molecular structure, such as
iodine, can also form crystals (Figure 5.11). This reflects
the regular packing of the molecules in a lattice structure.
I
I
I I
I

Figure 5.11 Iodine molecules are arranged in a
lattice structure.
Ice also forms a crystalline lattice. Ice and water have
peculiar properties because of hydrogen bonding (see
page 66).
The distance between the nuclei of neighbouring iodine
molecules is greater than the distance between the nuclei
within the iodine molecule. This is because the forces
between the molecules are weak van der Waals’ forces
whereas the forces between the atoms within the molecule
are strong covalent bonds. Very little energy is needed
to overcome the weak van der Waals’ forces between the
molecules. The lattice is easily broken down when iodine
crystals are heated; iodine has a low melting point.
Giant molecular structures
Some covalently bonded structures have a threedimensional network of covalent bonds throughout
the whole structure. We call these structures giant
molecular structures or giant covalent structures.
They have high melting and boiling points because of
the large number of strong covalent bonds linking the
whole structure. Both elements, such as carbon (graphite
and diamond), and compounds, such as silicon dioxide,
can be giant molecular structures. Carbon and graphite
are different forms of the same element. Different
crystalline or molecular forms of the same element are
called allotropes.
Graphite
In graphite, the carbon atoms are arranged in planar
layers. Within the layers, the carbon atoms are arranged
in hexagons. Each carbon atom is joined to three other
carbon atoms by strong covalent bonds (Figure 5.12). The
fourth electron of each carbon atom occupies a p orbital.
These p orbitals on every carbon atom in each planar
layer overlap sideways. A cloud of delocalised electrons
is formed above and below the plane of the carbon rings.
These electron clouds join up to form extended delocalised
rings of electrons.

QuestIon
80Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryFigure 5.12 The structure of graphite.
The layers of carbon atoms are kept next to each other by
weak van der Waals’ forces.
The properties of graphite are related to its structure.
■■ High melting and boiling points: there is strong covalent
bonding throughout the layers of carbon atoms. A lot of
energy is needed to overcome these strong bonds.
■■ Softness: graphite is easily scratched. The forces between
the layers of carbon atoms are weak. The layers of graphite
can slide over each other when a force is applied. The layers
readily flake off. This ‘flakiness’ is why graphite is used in
pencil ‘leads’ and feels slippery.
■■ Good conductor of electricity: when a voltage is applied, the
delocalised electrons (mobile electrons) can move along
the layers.
Diamond
In diamond, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds
with other carbon atoms (Figure 5.13). The carbon atoms
are tetrahedrally arranged around each other. The network
of carbon atoms extends almost unbroken throughout the
whole structure. The regular arrangement of the atoms
gives diamond a crystalline structure.
Figure 5.13 The structure of diamond.
The properties of diamond are related to its structure.
■■ High melting and boiling points: there is strong covalent
bonding throughout the whole structure. A lot of energy is
needed to break these strong bonds and separate the atoms.
■■ Hardness: diamond cannot be scratched easily because it is
difficult to break the three-dimensional network of strong
covalent bonds.
■■ Does not conduct electricity or heat: each of the four outer
electrons on every carbon atom is involved in covalent
bonding. This means that there are no free electrons
available to carry the electric current.
Most of the diamonds used around the world have
been mined from the Earth’s crust. However, artificial
diamonds can be made by heating other forms of carbon
under high pressure. Artificial diamonds are too small to
be used for jewellery but they can be used for drill tips.
Silicon(IV) oxide
There are several forms of silicon(IV) oxide. The silicon(IV)
oxide found in the mineral quartz (Figure 5.14) has a
structure similar to diamond (Figure 5.15).
Figure 5.14 The shape of these quartz crystals reflects the
regular arrangement of the silicon and oxygen atoms.

Figure 5.15 The structure of silicon(IV) oxide.
Each silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms but
each oxygen atom is bonded to only two silicon atoms. So
the formula for silicon(IV) oxide is SiO2 . Silicon dioxide
has properties similar to that of diamond. It forms hard,
81Chapter 5: States of mattercolourless crystals with high melting and boiling points
and it does not conduct electricity.
Sand is largely silicon(IV)oxide.
Carbon nanoparticles
Graphite and diamond are not the only allotropes of
carbon. In recent years, substances called fullerenes have
been made. The structure of many fullerenes is based
on rings of carbon atoms, as is the structure of graphite.
But many fullerenes exhibit properties unlike those of
graphite. The individual particles in fullerenes may have
one of their dimensions between 0.1 and 100 nanometres
(1 nanometre = 10 –9 m). Particles of this size are called
nanoparticles. Another form of carbon, graphene, can be
regarded as a single layer of graphite.
Fullerenes
Fullerenes are allotropes of carbon in the form of hollow
spheres or tubes. They are similar in structure to graphite,
in that each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon
atoms. They contain rings of carbon atoms arranged
in hexagons and in addition many contain rings of
carbon atoms arranged in pentagons. The first fullerene
discovered was called buckminsterfullerene, C 60 (Figure
5.16). The C 60 molecule has the shape of a football (soccer
ball). The carbon atoms are arranged at the corners of
20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. The bonds where two
hexagons join are shorter than the bonds between the
hexagons and the pentagons. As in graphite, some of the
electrons in C 60 are delocalised, but to a lesser extent than
in graphite. Since the discovery of the C 60 molecule, many
types of buckminsterfullerene have been discovered. Some
are ball-shaped molecules that are multiples of C 60 , e.g.
C120 . Other fullerene molecules include C 20 , C 70 and C 72 .
a b
Figure 5.16 The shape of a buckminsterfullerene molecule,
C 60 , a is similar to that of a football b.
The properties of buckminsterfullerene are significantly
different from those of graphite and diamond.
■■ It has a relatively low sublimation point: it turns directly
from the solid to the vapour state when heated to about
600 °C. (Graphite only turns from the solid to the vapour
state at about 3700 °C). This is because there are weak
van der Waal’s forces between each buckminsterfullerene
molecule and no continuous layered giant structure as
in graphite.
■■ It is relatively soft because it does not require much energy
to overcome the weak intermolecular forces.
■■ It is a poor conductor of electricity compared with graphite
because the extent of electron delocalisation is lower.
■■ It is slightly soluble in solvents such as carbon disulphide
and methylbenzene. Neither diamond nor graphite is
soluble in common solvents.
■■ It is more reactive compared with graphite or diamond.
Buckminsterfullerene reacts with hydrogen, fluorine,
chlorine, bromine and oxygen. This is due to the relatively

electrophilic addition on page 209).
A second type of fullerene is a class of molecules described
as nanotubes. Nanotubes are fullerenes of hexagonally
arranged carbon atoms like a single layer of graphite
bent into the form of a cylinder (Figure 5.17). The first
nanotubes to be made were one layer of carbon atoms in
thickness. More recently nanotubes have behave been made
with thicker walls with several tubes inside one another.
Although the diameter of a nanotube is very small, it
can be made relatively long. The length of the nanotube
cylinder can be a million times greater than its diameter.
Figure 5.17 Part of the structure of a nanotube. The ends of
the cylinder are often closed.
Nanotubes have characteristic properties:
■■ They have high electrical conductivity along the long axis
of the cylinder. This is because, like graphite, some of the
electrons are delocalised and are able to move along the
cylinder when a voltage is applied.
■■ They have a very high tensile strength when a force is
applied along the long axis of the cylinder. They can be up to
100 times stronger than steel of the same thickness.
■■ They have very high melting points (typically about 3500 °C).
This is because there is strong covalent bonding throughout
the structure.
Fullerenes have a large range of potential uses.
Reactive groups can be attached to their surfaces and
metal complexes (see page 371) can also be formed.
Small molecules or atoms can be trapped in the cage
of buckminsterfullerenes. Possible medical uses
include delivering drugs to specific places in the body.
Nanotubes are used in tiny electrical circuits as ‘wires’
and as electrodes in paper-thin batteries. They can be
incorporated into clothing and sports equipment for added
strength. They have also been used in the treatment of
certain types of cancer.
Graphene
Graphene is a single isolated layer of graphite (Figure 5.18).
The hexagonally arranged sheet of carbon atoms is not
completely rigid and it can be distorted.
Figure 5.18 a Part of a graphene sheet. b ‘Waves’ in a sheet
of graphene.
Graphene has some of the properties of graphite, but they
are more exaggerated. For example:
■■ Graphene is the most chemically reactive form of carbon.
Single sheets of graphene burn at very low temperatures
and are much more reactive than graphite.
■■ Graphene is extremely strong for its mass.
■■ For a given amount of material, graphene conducts
electricity and heat much better than graphite.
It has been said that ‘a one square metre hammock made
of graphene could support a 4 kg cat but would weigh
only as much as the cat’s whisker’. Potential applications
of graphene include use in tiny electrical circuits and for
tiny transistors, touchscreens, solar cells and other energy
storage devices.

QuestIon
83Chapter 5: States of matterEarth’s crust are often thrown away. This leads to huge
waste dumps and landfill sites scarring the landscape
and problems with litter. Extracting metals from their
ores requires a lot of energy. Energy resources are also
limited and we need to conserve these as well. One way
to help conserve materials and energy is to recycle metals
(Figure 5.19).
Figure 5.19 Remember to recycle your cans. As well as
aluminium cans, we can also save energy and resources by
recycling steel cans.
Recycling materials
Large amounts of energy are needed to extract and purify
metals. It is often cheaper to collect used metals and
recycle them rather than extract them from their ores.
Recycling has several advantages:
■■ it saves energy (this helps tackle global warming, as we burn
less fossil fuel)
■■ it conserves supplies of the ore
■■ landfill sites do not get filled up as fast and there is
less waste
■■ it is cheaper than extracting the metal from the ore.
It is not always easy to recycle metals. They have to be
collected and sorted and then transported to the recycling
plant. This takes energy and money. It may be difficult
to separate individual metals. For example ‘tin’ cans are
made from steel coated with tin. The two metals have to be
separated before they can be used again. Two metals that
can be recycled easily are copper and aluminium.
Copper
Most copper ores remaining in the Earth contain less than
1% copper. Recycling copper is important because:
■■ less energy is needed to recycle copper than is needed
to transport copper ore to the smelting plant and extract
copper from it
■■ less energy is needed to extract and refine the recycled
copper so that it is pure enough to be electrolysed.
The copper used for water pipes and cooking utensils
does not have to be very pure, so little purification of
recycled copper is needed for these uses. The copper used
for electrical wiring has to be 99.99% pure. This has to be
purified by electrolysis.
Aluminium
Purifying and remoulding aluminium is much cheaper
than extracting aluminium from bauxite ore. Savings are
made because:
■■ it is not necessary to extract the aluminium ore from
the ground or to transport it to the smelting plant; these
processes require energy
■■ the treatment of bauxite to make pure aluminium oxide for
electrolysis does not need to be carried out
■■ the aluminium scrap needs less energy to melt it, compared
with melting aluminium oxide
■■ the expensive electrolysis of aluminium oxide does not need
to be carried out .
There is a 95% saving in energy if we recycle aluminium
rather than extract it from its ore.

■ The kinetic theory of gases states that gas particles
are always in constant random motion at a variety
of speeds.
■ The volume of a gas increases when the
temperature increases and decreases when the
pressure increases.
■ The volume of a gas under different conditions of
temperature and pressure can be calculated using
the ideal gas equation pV = nRT.
■ The ideal gas equation can be used to determine the
relative molecular mass of simple molecules.
■ Gases do not obey the ideal gas equation at low
temperatures and high pressures.
■ The kinetic-molecular model can be used to describe
the states of matter in terms of proximity and motion
of the particles, and to describe changes of state and
vapour pressure.
■ Ionic compounds such as sodium chloride and
magnesium oxide form a giant three-dimensional
lattice structure containing ions in a regularly
repeating pattern.
■ The strong ionic forces acting in all directions
between the ions in the lattice cause ionic
substances to have high melting and boiling points.
■ Simple molecular solids with low melting points such

they are crystalline. There are weak intermolecular
forces between the molecules.
■ Giant covalent (giant molecular) structures such as
diamond have a large number of covalent bonds
arranged in a regularly repeating pattern.
■ Fullerenes are allotropes of carbon in the shape
of hollow spheres (buckminsterfullerene) or
tubes (nanotubes).
■ Graphene is composed of a single flat sheet of
hexagonally-arranged carbon atoms.
■ The strong covalent bonds between the atoms in
giant molecular structures cause these substances to
have high melting and boiling points.
■ In metals, the atoms are closely packed in a giant
lattice in which the outer electrons are free to move.
■ Metals such as aluminium and copper and their
alloys have a variety of uses, which can be related to
their physical properties, e.g. density, malleability,
conductivity, hardness.

Chapter 6:
Enthalpy changesWhat are enthalpy changes?
Exothermic or endothermic?
Chemical reactions that release energy to the surroundings
are described as exothermic. In an exothermic reaction
the temperature of the surroundings increases. For
example, when magnesium reacts with sulfuric acid
in a test tube, the energy released is transferred to the
surroundings and the temperature of the reaction mixture
in the tube increases.
Mg(s) + H 2 SO 4 (aq)
MgSO 4 (aq) + H 2 (g) (energy released)
The surroundings include:
■■ the solvent (in this case water)
■■ the air around the test tube
■■ the test tube itself
■■ anything dipping into the test tube (e.g. a thermometer).
Other examples of exothermic reactions include:
■■ the combustion of fuels
■■ the oxidation of carbohydrates in the bodies of animals and
plants (respiration)
■■ the reaction of water with quicklime (calcium oxide) (see
page 166).
Chemical reactions that absorb energy from the
surroundings are described as endothermic. In an
endothermic reaction the temperature of the surroundings
decreases (Figure 6.2). For example, when sodium
hydrogencarbonate reacts with an aqueous solution of
citric acid in a test tube the temperature of the reaction
mixture in the tube decreases. The citric acid and sodium
hydrogencarbonate are absorbing the heat energy from the
solvent, the test tube and the air.
Other examples of endothermic reactions include:
■■ the decomposition of limestone by heating (all thermal
decomposition reactions are endothermic)
■■ photosynthesis (in which the energy is supplied by sunlight)
■■ dissolving certain ammonium salts in water
NH4 Cl(s) + aq NH4+ (aq) + Cl– (aq)

Figure 6.2 Using a cooling pack to treat a sports injury. When
the pack is kneaded, water and ammonium chloride crystals
mix. As the crystals dissolve, energy is transferred from the
surroundings, cooling the injury.
Introduction
When chemical reactions take place there is an energy
change. Energy can take many forms, including heat,
light, sound and electrical energy. The chemical energy
in the atoms and bonds of a substance is also very
important. One of the most obvious energy transfers in
chemical reactions is the transfer of heat (Figure 6.1).
A car engine gets hot when the energy is transferred
from the burning fuel. Fireworks release a lot of energy
as heat (as well as light and sound) when they explode.
Our bodies keep warm because of the continuous
oxidation of the food we eat.
Figure 6.1 The chemical reactions in this fire are releasing
large quantities of energy.

Cambridge International AS Level ChemistryEnthalpy changes and enthalpy profile
diagrams
We call the energy exchange between a chemical reaction
and its surroundings at constant pressure the enthalpy
change. Enthalpy is the total energy associated with
the materials that react. The symbol for enthalpy is H.
We cannot measure enthalpy, but we can measure an
enthalpy change when heat energy is exchanged with the
surroundings. We can write this as:
ΔH = Hproducts – Hreactants
enthalpy enthalpy of enthalpy of
change products reactants
The symbol Δ is the upper case Greek letter ‘delta’. This
symbol is often used to mean a change in a quantity.
For example, ΔT means a change in temperature and ΔH
means the enthalpy change.
The units of enthalpy change are kilojoules per mole
(kJ mol–1).
We can draw enthalpy profile diagrams (also known
as reaction pathway diagrams) to show enthalpy changes.
The enthalpy of the reactants and products is shown
on the y-axis. The x-axis shows the reaction pathway,
with reactants on the left and products on the right.
For an exothermic reaction, energy is released to the
surroundings. So the enthalpy of the reactants must be
greater than the enthalpy of the products. We can see
from the enthalpy profile diagram for the combustion of
methane (Figure 6.3) that Hproducts – Hreactants is negative.
We can include this information in the equation for
the reaction:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)
ΔH = –890.3 kJ mol–1
The negative sign shows that the reaction is exothermic.
For an endothermic reaction, energy is absorbed from
the surroundings by the chemicals in the reaction. So
the enthalpy of the products must be greater than the
enthalpy of the reactants. We can see from the enthalpy
profile diagram for the thermal decomposition of calcium
carbonate (Figure 6.4) that Hproducts – Hreactants is positive.
CaCO3 (s) CaO(s) + CO2 (g) ΔH = +572 kJ mol–1
The positive sign shows that the reaction is endothermic.
